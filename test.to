You are a Zionist propagandist and a pathological liar.

I think it's implied considering A. he's dead in the fourth panel, and B. the fist he makes in the third panel.
I certainly agree with you when it comes to application of force (aka the use of police power) as a general, catch-all disincentive. newlinechar  newlinechar In my view, the government should* only take away someone's freedom if they have done the same to someone else. Jailing people for not paying fines, taxes, failing to appear or something equally mundane, is counter-productive and not cost effective. We got rid of debtors prison for a good reason, and the government is still doing that, the only difference is they are the only debtor.  newlinechar  newlinechar `[*This is the utilitarian 'should'. In this context when I say 'should' I am referring to what is best for our society as a whole, over the long term. I am not appealing to any legal, moral or ethical standard.]`
Hold up there.... You didnt need the ACA to help folks with preexisting conditions. Over 30 states before the ACA had laws in place... The government could of simply written a law allowing individuals to buy insurance across state lines. When you get down to the nuts and bolts of the ACA is basically written by and for the insurance companies, it places folks in the 20s-30s under more financial pressure, who dont have the money to help subsides the healthcare system for the old. newlinechar  newlinechar With the amount of money spent on the ACA and website and setting everything up, it would of been better to place that money in a fund and create a list of medical conditions the government would subsidies, such as helping pay for a kid with downs syndrome, or cystic fibrosis etc, even the poor. We didnt need to screw up and entire healthcare system with more government it has already messed it up with medicare and medicaid rules, there has been no free market to bring down prices just government price setting that I wish people would wake up to. newlinechar  newlinechar Who cares about that stubborn idiot, let them be an idiot its not governments job to micromanage everyone life, when you make a law for that stubborn idiot the consequences for the rest of us are not fair. Just as the anti gun nuts cry out for gun bans, well I have 10+ guns in my house and guess what they have never been involved in a mass shooting or hurt anyone, but of course because a few bad apples did xyz everyone else that is responsible must give up their rights.
My specifics surround the bush family connection to the arabs, the Jewish controlled banking system which subsequently means they own everything.

The reason we pay for cops is so we will not be robbed in a dark alley and people cannot just piss everywhere. The union is being irresponsible and childish. The mayor supports cops being treated fairly. The union should be for this but they have stopped ensuring all officers are treated fairly and done there best to make sure all officers are treated preferentially.

To attempt to condense 2 hours of tightly packed and fascinating info into one comment.... (seriously just watch it, lots of amazing pictures/artifacts/bones here): newlinechar  newlinechar  That there is evidence that up to 4 different alien races have been visiting visiting the earth, they SHOW the evidence and its really neat and sure seems to be a lot of good evidence that civilization is a lot older than we are told and we have been lied to about our history. Some of it could be debunked, but there is a LOT of stuff most I'd not seen before; so much so really seems impossible to fake **all** of... or would at *least* doing so would also be an unbelievably elaborate conspiracy just as interesting.  newlinechar  newlinechar That the highest ruling class got there because of ties and perhaps even used genetic experimentation to make a hybrid with a Neanderthal. newlinechar  newlinechar That we are approaching a tipping point where something very evil or else very enlightening is happening soon, either a culling or else a grand awakening.  newlinechar  newlinechar That we are all one and have far more power to change the world than seems possible because we ARE the world, and quantom phisics is starting to prove that occultism could indeed be real.  newlinechar  newlinechar And yeah, this is more of a summarized summery of a summery and does not to it justice, seriously prob just watch it when you have 2 hours to kill because it is amazing. But this is the best TLDR I have time for on mobile right now, which is horrible because the 2-hour version already seems as boiled down as it could possibly be and the dude moves and speaks quickly.

That's the million dollar question, eh? I'm still working on it myself. I'll edit and link a post I made on New Years which is *my plan*, but, I have no idea of it'll work. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I feel like your logic is sound, but you aren't realizing a way to get those who are doing alright to join in. You have to make them want to do it. Just like their telescreens have told them they need to have the latest golf ball, blender, or SUV. But we don't have mass-media and beautifully created propaganda, we have but each other. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So what we have to do is show them that a supportive, cooperative society not based on debt and the *finer things* is a much more peaceful way to be, with better food, less stress and more time to slow down and really think about things. You can't think that way if you're still a hamster spinning on that wheel, because they're too busy making sure they don't fall ass over tea kettle. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Once they see that, they'll be on your side in a second. Because it's like being a kid again, only you're a fucking adult.  Because you're learning new skills to produce things that your community wants, while being artistic and expressive. Be it beer, bread, soap, pottery, knitted blankets/hats, whatever, there's a sense of pride where your social network would rather pay **you** for **your goods** instead of goods made in South East Asia Sweatshops and then marketed to bored, upper-middle class housewives who are either watching far too much television or far too much facebook. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Because there's a better way - and I think it starts this year.

Well for me I believe it's 100% possible that we might have gone to the moon because my grandfather worked for Gruman back in the day in long island, he helped design the first cameras that Went into space and a whole bunch of other things like the current box shape of an abulance. But I also have seen the footage and videos of the proof to show that the astronauts were using string and the fakeness of space. So to me this is not the fight if it was real or not. But again my countries constitution is being challenged and twisted to fit some satanic, gay,liberal, feminit agenda. I look back and see that once we as a people in Congress up to the 1940s would pray for guidance in the Name of Jesus Christ, but now  GOD is removed from everything from schools,workplaces,and our government. Yet we see that to pray to Allah in the senate House is OK...and I'm like wtf, Jesus is not allowed but the terrorists god is? Faith is What moves US and keeps US moral and centered.but What the agenda is trying to do is waste our arguments on vain things like 'did we really go to space' in reality if we just fix the government then we would know instead of trying to get the truth out of pathological liars ..I'm not for religion,I'm usually against it.but faith in GOD was What our founders made our constitution so wonderful.the principal of who Christ is has nothing to do What man made religion has become.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Sure, 98,000 people may die by accidents in hospitals, but how many people's lives are saved, or severe diseases stopped early by hospitals?  I assure you, if hospitals dissapeared today, people wouldn't get healthier. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not, by any means, saying our health care system is perfect, it's far from that, but it absolutely has net positive on public health, not a net negative. newlinechar  newlinechar And while you may think that public schools fill their minds with falsehoods, that is a complete over-simplification.  Depending on the school, the cirriculum, the teacher, what children learn in history class might be more or less accurate. newlinechar  newlinechar And that's not to mention, EVERYTHING ELSE, reading skills, writing skills, math, physics, art classes, science classes, research projects, papers and reports that expand children's knowledge and inspire them to be curious and teach them the skills through assignments to learn about anything else they might be curious about. newlinechar  newlinechar To say school makes people dumb is fucking retarted. newlinechar  newlinechar I learned a TON in school, and I can't imagine an alternative available to people that would do a better job of improving my intelligence growing up. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, I'm not saying school is perfect, but it is a CLEAR net positive on intelligence, not a net negative as you claim.

Really?! An elected official just tweeted a racially charged threat about something largely believed to be a myth, and I am supposed to ignore that?

How has the media portrayed them? As a racist group that only exists because we have a (half) black President. To ignore what is happening and those who are 'fanning the flames' to gain political points is only going to prolong the issue.

So now you have hundreds of large competitors including the state which standardizes it.   newlinechar  newlinechar If states individually controlled it, the system before the ACA wouldn't even be touched.  That is because the market has competition if your insurer didn't cover it before.  This includes pre-existing conditions,  which is the only part of the ACA I firmly support, that and the increased age under parental coverage being a good thing.    newlinechar  newlinechar So let's say CA has a better system than NY.

So basically Winston Smith's job in the George Orwell novel Nineteen Eighty Four? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of The Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from The Times of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, The Times of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. '
&gt; Gleiwitz_incident newlinechar  newlinechar In the official German documents about the border raids, there are mentioned fully 44 acts of Polish aggression over the six days and nights before the German invasion (which began around 4 a.m. on September 1st). On the night of August 31st, there were reportedly 14 incidents of provocation by Polish irregulars of which Gleiwitz and Troppau were but two. In this text, it is clearly stated that the attackers did not wear Polish uniforms, but that they were irregular troops, based in Hohenlinde and in Gleiwitz. And finally, according to the German documents detailing Polish prewar attacks, the post of Hohenlinde was not burned (as stated by H. S. Hegner) but merely occupied. newlinechar  newlinechar In [his speech](http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/document/HITLER1.htm) to the nation on Sept. 1, 1939, Adolf Hitler did not mention, except indirectly, this so-important Gliewitz “false flag” that was supposedly ordered by him to justify his invasion order, but instead spoke at length about the ongoing provocations over the past four months by the Poles. He pointed out that since 1919-1920, 100,000 ethnic Germans who were Polish citizens had been forced to flee their homes in Poland. newlinechar  newlinechar He had only this to say about what occurred during the previous night: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;These proposals for mediation have failed because in the meanwhile there, first of all, came as an answer the sudden Polish general mobilization (Aug. 30), followed by more Polish atrocities. These were again repeated last night (Aug. 31). Recently in one night there were as many as twenty-one frontier incidents: last night there were fourteen, of which three were quite serious. I have, therefore, resolved to speak to Poland in the same language that Poland for months past has used toward us. This attitude on the part of the Reich will not change. newlinechar  newlinechar Further on in his speech, Hitler said newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This night for the first time Polish regular soldiers fired on our territory. Since 5:45 A.M. we have been returning the fire, and from now on bombs will be met by bombs. newlinechar  newlinechar Fire coming across the border from Polish regular soldiers does not mean a raid on a radio station by irregulars. The raid on the Gleiwitz station and the customs house in Hohenlinde must be included in the “three which were quite serious.” But is that how a leader makes use of a “false flag” event that he ordered, intending to use as a pretext? No. newlinechar  newlinechar The words “Gleiwitz” or “radio station” never came up in the speech, nor afterward from Hitler. So much for it being a German “false flag” from the German perspective! newlinechar  newlinechar to sum up why the official narrative of the Gleiwitz incident is just another fabrication: newlinechar  newlinechar * Robert Jackson admitted that a “fair trial” would not give the U.S. and Roosevelt the outcome they wanted; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * Almost all accounts are repeats of one written for the Allies by the mysterious H.S. Hegner; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * There are some differences between it and the affidavit signed by Alfred Naujocks for the Nuremberg prosecutors; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * Alfred Naujocks - deserted and surrendered to the Allies in October 1944 and was released 1945 newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * Erwin von Lahousen - heard from Canaris about the attack at Gleiwitz; he participated together with Wilhelm Canaris in the 20 July 1944 plot against Hitler newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * Wilhelm Canaris was collaborating with Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin who secretly discussed with British MI6 the plots against Hitler, since 1938. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * The Gleiwitz incident was just one of 14 cross-border raids on the night of August 31 by Polish irregulars; newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar * The National Socialists did not make use of the incident in their propaganda, which is what “false flags” are for. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [The Gleiwitz Incident – Nazi Plot or Allied Cover Up?](http://www.zioncrimefactory.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/The-Gleiwitz-Incident-Nazi-Plot-or-Allied-Cover-Up-Steven-Books.pdf) newlinechar  newlinechar Germany had more than enough legitimate reasons to invade Poland to help prosecuted Germans who got ethnically cleansed with full knowledge and support by the polish government. Almost 10k complaints have been filled by Germany with the league of nations about said atrocities against the German minorities in the Prussian corridor and Danzig, which are well documented but get down played and misrepresented as 'fifth column' by court historians.  newlinechar  newlinechar I will address Czechoslovakia in my edit. newlinechar

I have just a couple concerns that stick out. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Was Germany justified in putting Jews in concentration camps after the war had started? Considering various Jewish declarations to the effect of a 'holy war on Germany', then yes Germany was perhaps justified in doing this to the extent that the US was justified in doing the same to Japanese. newlinechar  newlinechar Was the 'holy war' not just essentially a boycott of goods? I know that they described as a 'declaration of war', but was there any actual violence occurring? Is that really justification for the mass imprisonment of an entire race, especially considering the horrendous conditions of the camps? What about the gypsy's, homosexuals, handicapped and others who were also sent to the camps? Why was their imprisonment justified? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;(5) Estimated Jewish losses in the camps? Well, considering I believe there was no policy of extermination, that the alleged methods of gassing were technically impossible [and also body disposal as described in the official narrative], and that the alleged structures used for gassings have been fairly definitively proven not to have been gas chambers, I would have to say much less than the official estimates of approx 3-4m. It's not really something I've studied, but in the interests of giving you some answer, I'll very tentatively guess 300-500k. [But I really don't know.] newlinechar  newlinechar With numbers so far below standard estimates, what do you think happened to all of those missing Jewish people after the war? The World Almanac published figures that show the population in 1938 at roughly 15 million. After the Almanac was able to successfully survey the population again in 1949 (previous years were based on 1938 estimates) the population was only 11 million. What happened to those roughly 4 million Jews?

As I said, my very simple set of equations neglect the energy lost to deformations (including pulverization), heat generation, and acoustic wave generation; it was just a quick and dirty 'here is what everyone saying 'conservation of momentum' is ignoring'.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The good news is though, in the sources I linked, they do not neglect the above terms. Equations 21 and 22 in the first linked source deal with exactly what you're asking and are simple algebraic expressions; if you want the full picture of the collapse though, you'll want to go through all the of vector-calculus that proceeds them. newlinechar  newlinechar [Here](http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/00%20WTC%20Collapse%20-%20What%20Did%20%26%20Did%20Not%20Cause%20It.pdf) is the source again for you convenience, calling attention specifically to  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The total gravitational potential energy Πg released by one tower is calculated as the tower newlinechar weight multiplied by the distance between the mass centroid of the tower and the mass centroid newlinechar of the rubble heap on the ground, and is approximately Πg = 8.25×1011 J. Eq. (21) represents newlinechar only about 7.65 % of 2Πg (both towers).

The remaining energy is dissipated by frictional and plastic deformations, and newlinechar ejection of air and other debris.
The 'Let It Happen' theory is, by and large, the stance any and every Truther should take, and for a handful of reasons, of which I'll begin to list here. newlinechar  newlinechar 1. There seems to be piles of proof leading to this conclusion. Thle Saudi funding, NORAD's response to the event, ALL THE RED FLAGS provided by international intelligence agencies, fucking Tenet (then Director of the god damn CIA) even warned the Bush Admin in Aug. 2001. Let alone Able Danger or the fact that we knew of one of the hijackers suspected cells operating quietly in NYC back in Jan of 2000. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Once you start going deeper down the rabbit hole (nano-thermite, collapse into the footprint, free-fall speed of the smoking gun WTC7, pools of heat NASA satellites photographed under the wreckage and the classified 'crash' video of the Pentagon), you begin an uphill fight. More and more proof is required to validate such damning claims (of which there sure is a fucking lot of). But then comes the debunkers, and at this point, it becomes a battle of semantics, which leads me to number... newlinechar  newlinechar 3. It sounds to me that these '28 pages' contain evidence of Saudi involvement, which should be clear as day to most people. If we, as a people, want to make a change, or bring the war-criminals called the Bush Admin to justice, we need to work with what we have as written evidence in the joke of a commission report. Yes, I know the commission was headed by members within Bush's cabinet, which would only seem to hinder the reports credibility (let's be honest, it's fuckin shit, not a single fucking investigation into WTC7? Really?). But is that really the case? If those pages show what sounds to be tangible evidence of Saudi's involvement as well as records of our intell agencies knowing full god-damn well what would happen, then proof of Bush and his admin's compliance can be set forward, without having to jump through the physics hurdles free-fall or foot-print collapse creates. newlinechar  newlinechar Long story short, those 28 pages could possibly contain the cold hard facts required to bring the fucking jokers in the old Bush Admin to justice. It would be lovely to watch Chenney dangle from a rope alongside Bush, Rice, Rumsfeld. newlinechar  newlinechar But, most importantly, it would bring closure to the families of the lost that know that the narrative fed to us over 'live' television was bullshit. 3000 families deserve an answer, even when the answer is as dark as this one. newlinechar  newlinechar This isn't the proof we need, but the proof we deserve. And who knows, maybe it would be enough to start a repeal of the Patriot Act, or abolish the DoHS and the TSA. One can only hope...

It was, after all, the single purpose for insulating the beams in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar But you're saying the very thing, at design, engineers predicted might occur (structural fire - but this fire was much hotter), and therefore justified hundreds of thousands in expense, didn't happen? And that the documented failure didn't actually happen? newlinechar 
Large companies are using regulation to stifle development and innovation because it's cheaper than rolling out the next stage from r&amp;d a few years early. Everything about this process is just batty.

That's why I'm here. It's obvious that there's a nongovernmental (or supergovernmental) imbalance of power in the west. That's why I read this sub.

I'm just a citizen who wants to bring about change based on the open dissemination of information and this is one avenue I draw from to aggregate my worldview. 
If you burn 1 kilo of jet fuel it will create about 1.2 kilos of water which turns instantly into about 1,600 litres of superheated water vapour (steam). It's this rapid creation of vapour, plus the creation of CO2 gas, which pushes the aircraft forward. But it is minus 50 degrees Centigrade up there and the steam almost instantly freezes into ice crystals. If the surrounding air is carrying water vapour this will freeze onto the crystals through a process called Deposition and they will grow into snowflakes. It's all simple science which chemtrail believers either don't understand or choose to ignore.

The markets were crashing and the PATRIOT Act is mostly a banking act to stop the barely-rich from securing their money.  Do you remember the argument that we need to be able to find what the terrorists do with their money (repeated with a modern twist as *Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit against Russians* propaganda)? During the 2001 market low/crash it was a great time to pass though a screw the middle class and barely-rich banking bill.  Later during the crisis in 2008-2009 a large group of billionaires met to figure out how to save the world by getting their money out of harms way and into secure philanthropically covered trusts (and Gates did this as well).  They've been working on shutting down secure banking for the last 15 years to the point even Switzerland has been undermined.  The government now is in the business of deciding what is rich enough and they are going to continue lowering that glass ceiling until there is a near impassable barrier between middle class and elite.  The people who think that they are rich now but hostage to the stock market withdraw taxation rates will eventually come to learn that they are in reality just stuck in a diminishing middle class. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm just now back in the US for the last few weeks and I've heard on the radio an older woman who has $35k seized from her business account because she operated a cash only restaurant (to not pay CC fees).  The IRS just seized her money and she has an attorney pro-bono to get the money back.  They charged her **money** and not her because she 'structured' the money by depositing amounts greater than $10k in many steps (aka depositing her daily cash revenue - as in what the fuck are banks for anyways?). newlinechar  newlinechar Recently there have been some changes that allow innanimate objects to be charged.  Funny word *charged*.  I charge your money with a crime.  I bet that if these cases go through that it turns out that they create a strawman for the money so that it can be processed in that way. newlinechar  newlinechar So what is a little borrowed military grade anthrax to get things moving in the right direction?

&gt; do not view the CIA as a group which runs candidates, but rather a bunch of thugs that pretty much does whatever the president wants, perhaps more for Repubs than Dems. newlinechar  newlinechar Just have to correct this.  It is very clear from the history that it works the other way around.  The 'institution of national security' transcends presidencies, thus their justification for control over that presidency. newlinechar  newlinechar Jimmy Carter's presidency is a short-lived one where he tried to push back against the CIA (fired GHW Bush) who returned fire with an oil embargo and the October Surprise. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for the discussion.

I feel like one thing you're missing is that these margins are currently hurting domestic US production, specifically shale oil. newlinechar  newlinechar In this [Bloomberg piece](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-05/oil-below-60-tests-u-s-drive-for-energy-independence.html) from yesterday, they stated that at least one oil company had budgeted for $80-100/barrel. It also stated that everyone's favorite, Halliburton, plans on laying off employees (they supply fracking equipment, among other fantastic things of course. It also notes that the price of around $50/barrel was: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;... below the break-even price for 37 of 38 U.S. shale oilfields, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. newlinechar  newlinechar So - economic warfare a là John Perkins? Not really. But make no mistake - this will certainly inconvenience some oil dudes in the US, while helping us proles out with cheaper gasoline. newlinechar  newlinechar It's actually not unlike sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation and the DPRK, where they target specific individuals in industry and government. Only Saudi is doing it the only way they can, really - with Brent crude. 
Daniel Webster is a moderate though, [according to Heritage anyway](http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/members) (56% lifetime rating). The feeling I get is no one in Congress is *really* conservative. Just varying center-right people trying to ride the conservative movement into power.

I'm *guessing* that H.Res.428 was intended as a message (threat) to the Saudis...*'either go along with our plan to punish the Russians, or who knows, maybe the Chairman of this here [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence](http://intelligence.house.gov/) might suddenly take interest in this daft resolution that more and more co-sponsors are currently signing onto.'* newlinechar  newlinechar The Chairman of HPSCI at the time the resolution was introduced (113th Congress) was [Rep. Mike Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rogers_%28Michigan_politician%29) [MI-8], since retired (now into talk radio: '[Something To Think About](http://www.westwoodone.com/PROGRAMMING/New-in-2015/Something-to-Think-About-with-Mike-Rogers)'). Mike started out with the FBI, investigating organized crime and public corruption, but soon changed careers and entered politics (same skill set), first in the Michigan Senate, then the U.S. Congress in 2000. He was a member of HPSCI for 10 years, and Chairman for the last 4 years. He surely read those 28 redacted pages of the 9/11 Joint Intelligence Committee Report in question ([H. Rept. 107-792](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=107/HRPT/[700%3b799]&amp;granuleId=CRPT-107hrpt792&amp;packageId=CRPT-107hrpt792)) at some point, but let H.Res.428 die in committee anyway...[because the Saudis cooperated on oil prices](http://i.imgur.com/ZyqqM1K.jpg)??? newlinechar  newlinechar Boehner could have also demanded Rogers move the resolution along, but obviously chose not to. newlinechar  newlinechar The new Chairman of HPSCI is (Republican) [Devin Nunes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Nunes) [CA-22], a farmer from the San Joaquin valley who started his federal career in 2001 thanks to a Dept. of Agriculture appointment by George W. Bush. Therefore, one shouldn't expect any secrets damaging to his benefactor to leak in the next 2 years.   newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: the redacted 28 pages, titled *“Finding, Discussion and Narrative Regarding Certain Sensitive National Security Matters,”* begins on [page 395 of the report](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-107hrpt792/pdf/CRPT-107hrpt792.pdf). newlinechar  newlinechar UPDATE: *Families of 9/11 victims push for release of report's final 28 pages* ([06 Jan 2015 / CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/06/politics/9-11-report-final-pages/)) newlinechar 
It's poking fun at over sensitivity of the mother actually. It's a guy saying he doesn't want to date someone who doesn't have a body type he finds attractive.

&gt; This is an old interview from when she first started campaigning. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah.  I thought this was a touch dated...so something in the back of my head felt 'A LOT could have changed in her life from that interview to today.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; In more recent days she has started distancing herself from 'chemtrails' and she makes it clear she doesn't believe they are real. newlinechar  newlinechar Really?  Got a video or an article showing this?  Not saying you're lying, but would like to see it myself.  Not only that, but this 'recant' sounds a LOT like what happened to David Cole/Stein - the Jewish guy who absolutely knew for a fact that the Zionist holocaust propaganda was greatly exaggerated and a lie, and released a very effective documentary literally showing all the holes in what is spread in the MSM...and then he was harassed and his life threatened by the ADL to such a great degree that he literally recanted everything he had said prior and never pursued the matter again.  Shit got memory holed big time. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; She admits that her knowledge about chemtrails came from watching What In The World Are They Spraying and she now realises that video is a heap of crap. newlinechar  newlinechar Ha.  Yeah.  She goes from being a military professional with specific and acute knowledge of what exactly is being sprayed and why to someone who says 'Aw naw.  All my knowledge on the subject just came from watching this little documentary called What In The World Are They Spraying that got debunked.' newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah...right. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, if she's NOT a military professional like she said she was, then that means that she was IMPERSONATING a military individual - which is 100% against the law and will get you a few years in prison with a fine of a few tens of thousands of dollars.  This is a fact.  Think about this.  She's a single mother with a child.  I don't think she would risk saying everything she said only because of some video she said she saw online. newlinechar  newlinechar Seems like what happened is that she said 'Fuck the power' and she *actually did the right thing* by coming out with her information...but before she knew it, she realized she was in WAAAAYYYY deeper and much more over her head than she initially thought and anticipated.  TPTB flexed on her, came down and threatened not only her life, but her kid's life, and next thing you know, she's saying 'Whoo boy!  I don't know WHAT I was thinking when I said all that!  It was all just a joke!  I did it for the lawls!' newlinechar  newlinechar tldr:  Sounds like she was most definitely silenced.
This is really fucked up.  Why would they wanna create a device specially shutting down a person ability to film an event?

That history is so violent really.

It's interesting that you say your point is that everything can be taken out of context, but fail to notice one thing. I'll get to that in a second. newlinechar  newlinechar Christians and Jews understand Biblical context better than anyone else. Often times it's convenient to ignore these passages because it's easier to appease our own lifestyles. But though we ignore them even when we ought not to, there is still one blindingly obvious fact that cannot be ignored. That is that Jesus taught love to spread the message of God. To achieve the same effect Muhammad taught war. newlinechar  newlinechar I will give you this: Muslims understand Islamic context better than anyone else. However, we observers understand Islamic context too. This leads me to my point. Here is the critical thing you've missed. Muslims understand Islamic context so well that they put it into practice worldwide. Here's something you've never read: 'Muslim evangelists killed by Christian fundamentalists'. Why? Because it simply does not happen on a daily basis. newlinechar  newlinechar Christians and so-called 'Islamophobes' understand the context vicariously through the actions of Muslims who put the tenets of the faith into action. We know this is the context because any honest historian will tell you that this is so because Muhammad himself practiced these horrible things. You're supposed to lead by example. This world has many problems because Christians don't follow the example of Christ, myself included. This world also has many problems because Muslims follow Muhammad's example to the letter. newlinechar  newlinechar That's as simply as I can put it.

And going further with that, all the talk about discrepancies in official documentation (His SS being from Connecticut, Other Birth Certification irregularities, etc...) actually play into it.  They can go say, look at those crazies and everyone would fall in line.
Thank you very much.  This is excellent!
Im an atheist, but I will be the first to tell you that most atheists are straight assholes. It seems that not only do they hate Islam for very good reasons being mentioned here, they also have a tendency to equate Islam with other religions (especially Christianity) and therefore some *still* have a very hard time identifying and defining our enemy.

Try looking at this from a different perspective: If we didn't exist, or the world didn't exist, or even this galaxy exist.

You're conflating all leftist movements with communism. Of course communism is going to be anti Christian and anti religion. The end goal of Marxist thought is to eliminate social hierarchy and religion almost always has a hierachical element to it. newlinechar  newlinechar We're not talking about communists. We're talking about US Democrats, the mainstream leftist movement, which has essentially no overtly communist element to it.

Agreed, but he wasn't fired for that. Those comments were made in 1982. He was fired 20 something years after that.

A lot of those people are also from developing countries, where they have less education and those things are a part of their culture.

I find it strange that everyone knows Mossad and other Israeli agencies and forces are some of the best, deepest cover, most advanced intelligence agencies in the history of the world.

It can be argued that none are justified, but can just as easily be argued that many or most or all are. I don't care about that aspect of the debate right now.  newlinechar  newlinechar What bothers me is people that play coy with history and current reality, as if all Mossad ever did was wait for terrorists to attack and then try to stop them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Is Israel behind the Paris attacks? I can't imagine that being true.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you agree, make an actual point. There certainly seems to be standard delegitimization and obfuscation going on by accounts that are clearly here for that purpose.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have much of a dog in the Israel/Palestine fight.

Yeah, I'm doubting the validity of this quote. I study American political thought and to often do the foundung fathers become a mouthpiece for others through the use of spurious quotes. Monticello's website has a good section on bs quotes.

Yes, but using a different MO to imply that it could be Israel is really shitty reasoning.
&gt;  It's either human rights and privacy or a false sense of security. What do you choose? newlinechar  newlinechar Well we're not exactly maximizing either right now. We're being spied on wholesale and terrorists that the intelligence agencies are aware of are pulling off attacks. (and there are no examples of true plots being thwarted prior to them happening. Multiple studies have shown that 90%+ of the terrorist arrest by the FBI are people who were never capable of it and were being helped by the FBI) newlinechar  newlinechar So I think questioning the current path we're on is pretty valid. Especially when you look at the reports on what kind of results we're getting from the spying. The return is not worth the cost by several orders of magnitude. That's not even mentioning the TSA.
I certainly would.  A college degree not only shows that you have some kind of knowledge but also show that you had the dedication and work ethic to earn it.  And without one I think he will be attacked a lot more.  I mean what would you think of a Democrat running without a degree?

Because Charlie Hedbo had been under threat from radical islamists since 2006. Their offices were firebombed that year, and several of the employees were under constant police surveillance because of the threat. Survivors were told that they were from Al-Quaida, on video clips from the attack they are heard yelling 'Allah is great!' and 'The prophet has been avenged'. Both brothers had been under surveillance for several years before the attack for their ties to radical islam, at least one of them had been to a Yeminite training camp.

LOL, ok NARC, how do you know they are professionals,(you state thatthey where not well trained) (contradiction???)  that this is their first time? If they are as you claim trained somehow in the middle east, then, this is probably not a first, Also how can they then be professionals if they have no experience? They used their heads how? there is no way to really determine traffic. Or do you have one. ANd if they were 'using their heads' then how later did they panic and leave the wallet in the decoy car? professionals and anyone with half a brain cell functioning would never bring any ID with themselves. If things were planned as well as you surmise, their would of been no mistakes. SO, are they professional or not? did they panic or use their heads? Can't have it both ways, even if you get paid per post......Also, where do you get the idea that what you wrote is what everyone on this subreddit thinks. You are part of this sub? therefore, you must think that.

When it's advice, I see no reason to act so upset or make such a big deal out of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I remember news outlets claiming that Bush said that America should 'go shopping' after 9/11.

The way I see it, he's advising we exercise caution.  newlinechar  newlinechar I read Bush's speech excerpt and I read Obama's speech excerpt. They were both offering sound advice.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's interior minister promised on Monday to crack down on anti-Semitism after violence marred pro-Palestinian rallies in and around Paris to protest against Israel's role in the two-week-old Middle East conflict. newlinechar  newlinechar France has both the largest Jewish and Muslim populations in Europe and flare-ups of violence in the Middle East often add to tensions between the two communities. newlinechar  newlinechar Local media showed the burnt-down front of a kosher grocery shop in the heavily Jewish Parisian suburb of Sarcelles after a non-authorized protest on Sunday. Last weekend pro-Palestinian marchers clashed with riot police outside two Paris synagogues. newlinechar  newlinechar 'It is unacceptable to target synagogues or shops simply because they are managed by Jews,' Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve told reporters during a visit to Sarcelles, which is also home to large non-Jewish immigrant populations. newlinechar  newlinechar 'Nothing can justify anti-Semitism, noting can justify that kind of violence. This will be fought and sanctioned,' he said. newlinechar  newlinechar Local media said youths in Sarcelles clashed with police and cars were burned amid widespread looting that also hit non-Jewish targets. Clashes had marred another non-authorized protest in Paris on Saturday, while other rallies around France went ahead peacefully with the permission of local authorities. newlinechar  newlinechar Some protesters and even ruling Socialist politicians criticized the bans on the Sarcelles and Paris rallies as counter-productive. But Cazeneuve said he would react the same way if mosques or churches were targeted. newlinechar  newlinechar In the first three months of 2014 more Jews left France for Israel than at any other time since the Jewish state was created in 1948, citing economic hardships in France's stagnating economy but also rising anti-Semitism as a factor. newlinechar  newlinechar Since fighting in the Middle East started on July 8, the death toll has passed 500, with 484 Palestinians among the casualties as Israeli jets and tanks pound Gaza. The U.N. Security Council has called for an immediate ceasefire. newlinechar  newlinechar Some pro-Palestinian protesters have accused France of siding with Israel in the conflict, citing the rally bans and a statement by President Francois Hollande's office saying Israel was justified in taking action to assure its citizens' security. newlinechar 
&gt;One wouldn't have time for that kind of depression at the start of the biggest case of your life. newlinechar  newlinechar That's really, really not true, and anyone that has had true depression will tell you that. If you're depressed, something like that won't make you suddenly snap out of it. You would be more likely to think along the lines of 'what does it matter? I don't deserve to have this case, and I probably won't even be able to do much with it. And even if I do, it'll probably just be because I got lucky, and I'll still be a worthless human being... etc, etc.' newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not arguing whether or not he actually committed suicide. Just pointing out that this line of thinking is absolutely ridiculous. Which is why if anyone ever tells you they are depressed, don't start in about 'how can you be depressed, you have ____ and you just ____! You have a great life! What do you have to be depressed about?' newlinechar Because the thing about depression is it makes you *fundamentally incapable* of experiencing the happiness and joy that experiences and events *should* bring you. newlinechar  newlinechar

&gt; Fish do not gradually become cats newlinechar  newlinechar That's not how evolution works. Nobody has ever claimed this. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What? newlinechar  newlinechar The geocentric model requires the assumption that the universe essentially revolves around the earth, since otherwise the universe would be completely stationary, which is not the case. However, since neither of these are possible, geocentrism has a major obstacle.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The Michelson-Morely experiment and Airy's failure both indicate the Earth is stationary and the heavens are moving. All experiments devised to show that the Earth is moving have failed to show any movement. That's called indication that the Earth is stationary. newlinechar  newlinechar None of them were trying to prove that. They were trying to prove the aether hypothesis, which is entirely different, and each of them failed to prove it, since the aether does not exist. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; So cite proof of relativity and proof that dark matter exists, then. Why are they trying to prove the existence of dark matter right now to verify their theories? newlinechar  newlinechar Sure? For dark energy, which you also pointed out, [here's a page about proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy#Evidence_of_existence) for dark matter, [here's something by NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2006/aug/HQ_06297_CHANDRA_Dark_Matter.html), and [here's something by Cornell](http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/dm_evidence.htm). As for relativity, the major points are as follows: newlinechar  newlinechar * Measurements of various quantities are relative to the velocities of observers. In particular, space contracts and time dilates. newlinechar  newlinechar * Spacetime: space and time should be considered together and in relation to each other. newlinechar  newlinechar * The speed of light is nonetheless invariant, the same for all observers. newlinechar  newlinechar Please explain why any of these are wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Disproving relativity brings the ether back in and removes the need for dark matter and dark energy. newlinechar  newlinechar But we've already disproven the aether. Why bring it back? *That's the whole point of the three experiments you listed*.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I don't think you realize how much hinges on and is written around relativity being true without any proof. newlinechar  newlinechar I do understand relativity, since I kinda had to take a course in it.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; A stationary Earth means absolute motion of the universe. It's a whole new ballgame. newlinechar  newlinechar And a wrong one. In fact, it's so far off, [it's not even wrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong).

You still need a crumple zone, or you're not absorbing the impact... Making a car more rigid is generally very detrimental to the safety of the occupants, except for conditions where the impact only occurs to the top third of the car. Which is what makes underride collisions and things like moose impacts so deadly. Unfortunately you can't just make the bars at the front of the car stronger without it impacting safety in things like t bone collisions, which are much more common. Here you need the car to crumple in order to absorb at least part of the impact. And although it might look gruesome when the entire side of a car is smashed in, that's a collision where the occupants would simply not have survived if the car was rigid. But with the car absorbing a significant portion of the impact you now have a situation where occupants on the other side of the vehicle have a chance.

This could make all gmos, pesticides and insecticides obsolete.
That’s a good point, and they’ve already done some tax-cutting there.
You are correct, and that's what scares me. I think we have, as a nation, forgotten what 'God-given' rights actually are. If we truly understood what God-given rights were, we would not be in this situation now. And the government would be much smaller than it is.
I upvoted you for that statement and am a fan of that sub...statement confirmed lol 
No, a republican. They would vote for a black republican in a heart beat just to keep a 'god damn democrat' out of office.

From a dozen or so? Not too much differs in the experience overall. But IMO, each time you go 'there', you essentially take part of the experience back with you. The first several times you experience it, it's so earth shattering that you can't put anything into words, because the experience transcends language. You slowly but surely gain a better insight into what's happening the more you do it. So... after a dozen or so times, you'll get the idea.

No they shouldn't. When a creditor loans someone money, the risk they take on is that they won't get the money back. The debtor who does not pay back the loan in full will suffer the consequences in the form of a lower credit score or outright bankruptcy.  newlinechar  newlinechar The possibility that the debtor will not be able to pay back the creditor is built into the contract. Interest rates on loans dictate the credit worthiness of the borrower. Unless otherwise stipulated in the contract, no one can be expected to be arrested should they not be able to pay back a loan. Unless, of course, it was a government loan, in which case the statue of limitations go out the window.
I really don't think Carlin and Hicks are too similar(although they appear similar on the surface).  Carlin was a lot more 'mainstream' and 'relate-able'.  Hicks was a lot more controversial, dirty, and counter-culture.  Hicks was religious.  Carlin was not.  Hicks spoke about spiritual enlightenment(in fact, he didn't view himself as a comedian, but as a spiritual teacher).  Carlin's outlook was that we were fucked(and more fucked as he got older).  Hick's was that we needed to wake up, and we would be saved.  In reality, they were two very different men, who were opposed to a lot of the same people.

&gt; 'Corporate science' as you call it, asks people to ignore the findings that result from scientific thinking.  newlinechar  newlinechar Correct.  However, it also substitutes *real* science with corporate science.  Problem with that is that most people have absolutely no idea what the difference between corporate science and real science is.  This, of course, is done on purpose by TPTB so that the people remain ignorant. newlinechar  newlinechar When you have some of the biggest, most popular, most 'imminent' scientists actually espousing and backing up the tripe that corporate science advocates, then all those people that depend on 'science' to get their truth will end up looking to these 'scientific authority figures' for their information and will absolutely be led astray. newlinechar  newlinechar Neil DeGrass Tyson, Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking.  All these (and many more) are imminent scientists that, along with the various important scientific discoveries that they've come in to, have also advocated a very, *very* closed version and perspective of real science and have kept the world more ignorant than not with regard to what is really happening on the planet and in the universe. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This does not invalidate the original scientific thinking. newlinechar  newlinechar Correct.  It absolutely does not.  What *does* happen, however, is that, as I said above, people get duped into thinking that the crony corporate science that they listen to is in fact *real* science - when it's absolutely not.  This is how you end up getting kids all over reddit and beyond that walk around poo pooing a lot of phenomena that is otherwise valid, but that is not readily advocated by 'mainstream science' and the 'peer reviewed journal system!'  They think that if it's not advocated by those areas, then the information is wrong, when the fact is that often it is the information that DOESN'T appear in those journals that is the *most* correct. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; the video makes it clear that it's not advocating everyone act like a pedant, just that they apply critical thought and logical thinking when considering new information. newlinechar  newlinechar Cool then.  I just think it's important that people don't get confused into equating the current stream of 'scientific thought' with *actual* critical thinking.

Should he NOT be liberal on civil liberties?
I think it's such an important point to get across, that speaking in general terms, the majority of cops most probably do have well meaning intentions, and aim toward working with integrity, just like most people who works in the community services sector. I had a conversation with a female officer years ago, after some jackass tried to grab me in the toilets at a club, and I'll never forget what she said- 'My Dad was a cop, and I always wanted to be a cop... as far as I'm concerned, as long as there's bad guys out there, I want to be doing something to catch them.' It was just such a shitty situation, and I was comforted somehow by that simple statement. She really seemed like someone who lived her truth, and that's what I like to remind myself of whenever we hear about the asshole cops ruining things for everyone-including other cops.
The magazine has released images making fun of Jews and Christians as well. 
Yeah. That's primarily what this article's about, that pharmaceutical companies routinely hide negative trial data and how this is killing people on a daily and needs to stop.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, with Tamiflu, even if you take into account the negative trial data that Roche attempted to hide then refused to provide, its negative effects and negligible benefits have been widely written about since 2007 - Japan banned its use for teenagers in 2007, Oxford researchers said 'stop giving this shit to kids' in 2009, UGA ran a meta-analysis that determined that it wasn't all that effective in 2012. This is not even to mention that the adverse effects are listed on the prescribing information.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tamiflu is a weird bird when it comes to malpractice in public view and the public's inability to question authority - yes, absolutely, Roche is a scumball and hid negative studies and they need to be punished for this and we need open trial data - however, Tamiflu was so widely prescribed and other researchers conducted studies, so its dangers have been publicized for at least 8 years now. But the CDC still recommends it and tells doctors to prescribe it, knowing the data shows that it can be dangerous and that if we're lucky and this wasn't just a statistical anomaly, it reduces symptoms by half a day.
&gt; This is the whole thing - judges know about their rights, and their office basically empowers them to make and interpret the law as they go along, in any way they choose, it's a serious office - it's scary for them to think about the public rabble realizing that they are the ones with the actual rights to do that for themselves newlinechar  newlinechar I know a lot of people don't like the soverign man movement but I've seen some judges who clearly knew these people were on to something and who looked scared as hell. This is the stuff they've been teaching 'behind closed doors' and as long as everyone just plays along with the current system it will never be a problem for them. newlinechar  newlinechar As soon as people start to stand up and challenge the system itself though they freak out.

The German economy during Hitler's reign was artificial and unsustainable.

Bomb calorie testing only accounts for what can be oxidized. Basically meaning what produces heat when lit on fire. So no, it does not distinguish fiber, which as you mentioned, some fibers are not digestible by the human stomach.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some foods are not digestible at all by the human stomach. Grasses, etc. Others are partially digestible, this includes a lot of proteins and fibers. Simple carbohydrates are the easiest and most digestible.  newlinechar  newlinechar So when humans eat, and the food arrives the the stomach, the liver begins producing the enzymes to break them down into simple sugars, like you mentioned. Not all of that food is broken down. Notably food that is not chewed properly and some of the harder foods to break down that I mentioned. These pass to the intestines and are not digested.  newlinechar  newlinechar The evidence is in the shit. Have you ever found certain foods in tact in your shit?  Ever shit bright green after eating too much spinach? Whole corn?  That's the Un-digested byproduct of what you didn't absorb and convert.  newlinechar  newlinechar A bomb calorimeter would have still registered that matter as energy. This is ONE reason that calorie reading on food are generally inaccurate. The other, which I hadn't touched on yet is compounding error. Most foods you buy are combined and packaged. Manufactures are only required to use the data from raw ingredients and compile/add. Not perform the test on their final product. The error here is that the final product may be more digestible than the original ingredient. If you pulverize certain foods and process them, it can make it easier to digest. Take a bowl of spinach and eat it raw. Then take that same bowl of spinach, blend it and cook it. You will actually get more nutrition from the cooked and blended spinach since the processing basically does the job of your teeth. Just more efficiently.

&gt; Feels just like a cold that won't go away. Mild for the younger/middle-aged set but harsh for the older set, and long-lasting, up to 10 days, newlinechar  newlinechar That isn't the flu. People think they get it when they don't. There are 2000 colds and viruses that exist out there. Which is why there isn't a cure for the common cold. Everyone who thinks they are sick, think they have the flu.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; (but they will never bother to test it to know for sure, so obnoxious),  newlinechar  newlinechar Because they know you don't have the flu. When you have the flu, if you can' text, type, talk on the phone, play on the computer, even watch tv, you don't have the flu. It will literally make you feel like you are on death's door, and it comes with a fever, a high one. When you have the flu, someone can put a gun to your head and you won't care.  newlinechar  newlinechar So if it does that to healthy people, imagine what it does to those who are weaker, like children and the elderly, which is why so many die or end up in the hospital.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If anyone has had these symptoms and has had a doc who cared enough to test, would love to know more.  newlinechar  newlinechar Love it when some yahoo thinks they know more than medical professionals. First off, docs don't need to test if they know the flu is active in your area. And they will know before the public does. Secondly, the test takes several days. If they suspect the flu, they treat. If not, they treat whatever it is. Tests are not conducted because you want to know then and there that it is or it isn't. If you have the symptoms, they will treat. Because the treatment is the same regardless.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And is it possible that this is just a B virus from the kids' FluMist this year that the adults are catching?) newlinechar  newlinechar Wow, with stunning insight like that, no wonder you are so much smarter than your dumb doctor.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Eric Holder did go down there but only in the fevered minds at infowars was his intent to add to the chaos.

I completely agree that we must strive to keep a record and reminders of history, but the reality is that the only way we will discover the truth about history is to start talking about right NOW.

Yes.  I would also add that a very high percentage of members in some groups (CFR, Freemasons for example) do not know the real purpose/aspirations of the group(which makes it WAY easier to hide your true agenda).  The CFR is really made up of a council of **very few** people who make decisions, and know/reap the true benefits.  The 'majority' of the CFR are just 'semi' rich, and famous people who join because of the prestige, social, and networking opportunities offered.  The 'globalist' agenda is wrapped in philanthropy, and good intentions, and this makes the people in the CFR think they are secretly helping the world(but the poor are too ignorant to know the CFR is helping them).  This combination of making members feel important, and helpful makes them help the CFR do things that might seem like you would need to be evil to do.  They feel like a doctor giving an baby a shot.  The baby is ignorant, and thinks the doctor is trying to hurt him.  Even though the baby will cry, and might even try to stop the doctor from giving him the shot, the doctor must give him the shot anyway, because he knows better than the infant.

The globalists have been creating anticipation in Canadians for a coming housing correction. I believe the favourite MSM CBC phase is 30% over valued, though I believe the next correction to be that of American 2008 proportions. If there's one thing I've learned from spying globalist conferences and publications, its that they try to slay the rent seeking elite from time to time, and doubly they use this as a means to wealth transfer from the old to the young where in the savages live their lives based solely on their survivalist need to accumulate wealth and materialist garbage. If we observe the explosion in condo/high density living spaces being dumped into Toronto, we can see that the city is being engineered to hold more people, also the carnival that was Ford also imposed more transit lines despite objections by the cities bourgeoisie plutocrats. Ford also helped with his clown show to divert attention away from this obvious engineering of the city which has been quite remarkable ever since the American housing deflation of 2008, though that in itself is tied to other globalist reforms taking place.  newlinechar  newlinechar With regards to waking people, I wouldn't bother as well. People are animals, they follow the herd, they don't question the perceptual box they put themselves in and see out of. The bankers are moving towards governance now that the system is transitioning to SDRs instead of USD as the primary global currency reserve, which means let the bankers take care of things with their reforms, because people do not want or care for responsibility unless it affects their own individual financial situation and that's only if they're capable of understanding it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know when the bubble will pop, but you should definitely look into it more since you have considerably more assets invested into real estate. Look into the issue of Rent Seeking in particular, I've heard the globalist economic school Standford, or SCID, their think tank/globalist economic institution mention this often with regards to India and China as a serious issue in regards to creating and expanding the middle classes in those countries. In fact I think I'll dig a little more into this when I have time.

&gt;But this hack was devastating to an entire company, its employees, and the country. newlinechar  newlinechar How was it 'devastating' to the USA as a country? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;what they did cost millions in damage and unmeasurable cost to the individuals it affected. newlinechar  newlinechar Where is the data proving it actually caused millions in 'damage', and in what forms are the damages, lost prospective future wealth? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, how was the cost to individuals it affected unmeasurable? newlinechar  newlinechar You can measure very well how it affected 'The Interview', and it seems like it just made it infinitely more popular, with the few theaters showing it selling out and everybody else paying to watch it over youtube or google movies or whatever else they distributed it over online. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems like the entire purpose was to see how ready people are to directly watch new release movies in their home instead of in the theaters. newlinechar  newlinechar They research market data on a daily basis, and I bet you they had data to know that enough people have a proper viewing space ( amount of people who have purchased large flat screens and surround sound systems, people do not buy that stuff unless they have a place to set it up, which is probably a multiple person viewing location in their home ). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This group newlinechar  newlinechar This is the problem, what group? We don't know who it is, or why they did it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they seem to have only formally represented themselves newlinechar  newlinechar How so? Did they put out an 'official' group name? Just keep in mind how easy it is to blame something on 'anonymous'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is an obvious need for a reinvention of how movies are created and distributed newlinechar  newlinechar LOL, and we've known what it is for over a decade now. newlinechar  newlinechar Allow us to purchase the movie and download it directly online, in whichever format we prefer, be it high quality .mkv or .mp4 , or lower quality .avi . newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;but I don't get how this hack solves that problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I explained, by 'hacking' Sony and forcing them to 'pull' the movies from theaters, they forced people who wanted to watch it on release but have no theater to see it at to see it online. newlinechar  newlinechar This allows Sony to see how many consumers are currently ready to enjoy viewing new release 'theater' movies at their homes instead. newlinechar  newlinechar This saves Sony so much money it's absurd, let's go over the figures. newlinechar  newlinechar They do not have to pay for: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Real film reels of the movie to be shipped to all the theaters playing it, those cost a lot of money. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Movie posters to be displayed at all the theaters playing it, those things don't print themselves and they do not print for cheap either. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Movie theater release scheduling/purchasing. Why do so many good movies not make it to theater while so many bad movies do? Most of those bad movies have far more money to afford getting in to theaters, so 'The Interview' saved on those costs.
When I was in college I took a class in Logic.  In that class the professor pointed out this as an example of a logical fallacy.  We have actors, many of whom are college drop outs, and when they give us their opinions on gun control/rights, taxes, socialism, politics, religion, so on and so forth, we take their opinions as fact.  They are actors, not politicians, or religious figures, or any of that.  So why take their opinions seriously when Gwenyth Paltrow gushes over the Obamas or when Michael Moore does a movie insulting the Republicans or accusing them of anything?   newlinechar  newlinechar And, speaking of Michael Moore, this son of a bitch is the last person on Earth who should be taking anyone in Congress, regardless of the political party, to task over what they do.  Michael Moore is a college drop out who is nothing more than a loudmouth uneducated liberal with a camera and a fan base.  For him to question the Bush administration they way he did was asinine, and insulting that so many people believed it.  Condelezza Rice knew her job.  If she said one country was friendly and the other was a threat, you could believe it because she was an expert in those fields.  Michael Moore wasn't and is not.  Clinton and Kerry aren't either.  Clinton was given the job as a bribe to get her out of the election in 2008 because she wasn't going to drop out on her own and Obama knew that her, him and McCain on the same ticket would mean a win for McCain.  She's demonstrated that she didn't know her job even one tenth as well as Rice did, same with Kerry.   newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for the rant there...

&gt;but those that fund the studies and the drug research are motivated to profit from treatment, not cure it, with a few notable exceptions. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They are also people themselves with families and friends. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Given how promising cannabis oil is at curing cancer, if medical companies were really interesting in curing the disease they would lobby congress to legalize the oil in every state. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the thing, Cannabis oil doesn't cure cancer. newlinechar  newlinechar Cannabinoids have shown some potential use as an anti-tumor agent in specific tumor types. That is not 'curing cancer'.  These facts are all readily admitted by the ACS.  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact the whole notion of 'curing cancer' is a bit of a myth. While i'm sure in the future there may be some genetic therapy available which may completely inhibit the body from ever developing cancer cells of any type- but for now, 'curing cancer' is really just 'defeating cancer**s**' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Oh, that's right you can't patent it...which is why the promise of cure/treatment from something so effective is so under researched. newlinechar  newlinechar Here's the thing that a lot of people seem to forget; medical research from an economic standpoint is an absolutely awful investment.  newlinechar  newlinechar For any other product, if I were an investor or just a Rich Guy, and someone told me that i wouldn't see a return on my investment for a *decade* (sometimes longer)- and even then only if the treatment is accepted and adopted, I would laugh them out of the room. Medical research is a monumentally expensive undertaking and i'm not just talking about bread. newlinechar  newlinechar Workers who need 6, 8, 10 years of eductation and relevant experience.  newlinechar  newlinechar New million dollar facilities and equipment. newlinechar  newlinechar Expensive logistical and material support. newlinechar  newlinechar It's truly a wonder anything gets figured out at all. newlinechar  newlinechar Furthermore, imagine being *that guy*. Imagine being the guy who does 'cure cancer'? If Pharmaco or Megapill or Interdrug did it they'd have streets named after them. Small countries would offer up all of their livestock to them. Greedy people like money but they also like fame and power. Nobel prizes to the research team and books and movies made about them.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly Cannibas research is underfunded because of ignorance.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Same applies to other natural/alternative cures. newlinechar  newlinechar No that's because they have zero efficacy
Eh...the energy of the overthrow may have been a united lower class, but what actually ended up happening was not good for said lower class. newlinechar  newlinechar The Romanovs (the czar family at the time) were the wealthiest people on Earth at the time. Russia is a land of natural resources after all.  And because of this they were a threat to the Rothschilds. newlinechar  newlinechar If you actually look at who was running and funding the 'Communists' it was ... *sigh* ... some Jewish people. (please don't flood me with responses about anti-semitism. Not all Jews are part of a global conspiracy. It's boring to debate you people at this point) But yes, it was Zionist Jews. newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, famed author of The Gulag Archipelago  , and staunch critic of Soviet totalitarianism only had one book ever be controversial in Russia, and that was '200 years together'. A book about the relationship between some Jews and Soviet totalitarianism. newlinechar  newlinechar If you hear about 'STALLIN KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN HITLER!!! EXPOSED!!!' then you need to look at the group of people Stalin delegated that out to. In almost all instances they were Polish Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, there is, to this day, something called the fifth column in Russia, which is basically the banking elite in Russia. They are called such because they obviously aren't working in favor of the average Russian (hmm...sounds similar to here...and most places actually...) And it is this fifth column which is spawned off of Russia's national bank (their federal reserve) which was set up and is still controlled by western banking elites. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, did I hear the ruble crashed and oil (Russia's main export) is at record lows?  newlinechar  newlinechar TO ADD ON: Take a look at the word 'czar'. Strange way to spell that word isn't it? I mean, if you asked me how to spell a word that sounds like 'zar' I would say spell it 'zar'. Why the silent C? Well now put a hyphen between C and ZAR and pronounce the C softly, like the word 'see'. Then you have 'see-zar' or? Cesar newlinechar  newlinechar Even more interesting? Hitler called Germany the Third Reich. Why not just 'The Reich'? Were there two Reichs before the Third Reich? Well, actually, there were.  newlinechar  newlinechar Third Reich= Third Rome newlinechar  newlinechar The Roman empire we all learned about in school (or more likely our own research) wasn't the last one. Because the reason the *Holy* Roman Empire was considered holy at all was because of the conversion to Christianity. When it fell, the next great Christian empire was the Second *Holy* Roman empire, or, Constantinople. newlinechar  newlinechar Then there was the split between the Roman Catholic church and the Russian Orthodox church (they have their own pope and everything too) and after that, the Russian empire considered itself to be the only *true* representative of a *holy* Russian- sorry, Roman...empire (it's still so gosh darn big isn't it?). newlinechar  newlinechar So we have a Russian see-zar...or...c-zar ... czar ( yes, it can be spelled *t*zar, but then you still get tee-zar) newlinechar  newlinechar So, czar Nicholas was that time's Cesar (or something like it...I mean, the wealthiest man in the world, and the ruler of the largest country in the world) and you have the Zionists. In other words, conflicting interests, and ideology. And then the czar and his entire family are murdered by revolutionaries funded by Zionists...Oh, now that all makes sense. newlinechar  newlinechar And the fact Russia is now ruled by obscenely wealthy oligarchs controlled by a central bank run by Western (Zionist) banking elites...yeah, that makes sense too.

Yeah, it's much more pernicious.

Now, the state minimum was $8/hr. and that's what new hires got, with raises of up to +$0.25/year, so I figured he was at $9.50 to $10.00 per hour.   newlinechar  newlinechar He was semi-political and expressed opposition to a proposed minimum wage increase.  I asked why.  He told me that he didn't think it was right new hires should get what he worked 4 years for, even if the minimum wage was enough to increase his pay at that point. newlinechar  newlinechar His relative standing by itself was something he valued.  **He would sacrifice gains to keep me poorer than him.**  Ain't that fucky?   newlinechar  newlinechar And he graduated college by the skin of teeth and didn't know how to function in lab environments, so he couldn't use his bio degree, either, so this guy had piles of student loan debt he was servicing on a cashier's wages.   newlinechar  newlinechar Self-oppressing poors, man.

The more I read Crowley's work and learn of who he was and what he actually did, speculation and hyperbole aside, the more I find myself agreeing with him, generally speaking..  newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, there are portions of some of his work I strongly oppose philosophically, those tainted by either the darker corners of his own psyche or by certain darker currents of those he was alleged to have channeled. I'll likely post a few key quotations from such material here (in the sub) eventually, something I had meant to do recently put postponed due to lack of interest. newlinechar  newlinechar Before one considers embracing or dismissing him or his philosophies as a whole, which are numerous and varied when fully taken into account, it's only fair for one to read of them for yourself and take from them what you will. That said, I do agree with a portion of your sentiment, that there are those with ill intent who exploit the teachings and influence of others for their own end, whether human or hypothetically a portion of those referred to as 'ascended masters' which could very well be nothing more than a hidden underlying component of the human psyche itself. Though, to refer to all of paganism or of Thelema (two distinct however superficially similar concepts) as inherently good or bad is somewhat short-sighted, a common misconception however I myself held for some time. In fairness, there is good and evil, pros and cons, beauty and horror to be found in both of them.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're looking for a basic overview pertaining to the concept of gnosis in general, in addition to what has already been posted, consider the following: newlinechar  newlinechar [Henosis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henosis) newlinechar  newlinechar [Great Work - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Work) newlinechar  newlinechar [Neoplatonism and Gnosticism - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism_and_Gnosticism#Philosophical_relations_between_Neoplatonism_and_Gnosticism) newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, it's good to be back man, and nice to see some familiar faces still fighting the good fight.

I can see where you're coming from. Even though the minimum wage has decreased in value over the years due to inflation, no new jobs have been created, and we have lost jobs. I believe the reason for this is that we can't compete with slave wages in other countries. If we did do this, there would be huge job growth in low skilled jobs almost overnight, but we would probably have to end up covering a lot more people with government benefits in the long run. I guess there would be no more inequality than there already is in the world, all that would happen is we would be less insulated from it.

This is pretty much the opposite of what America stands for.

Throughout the week of riots, mobs harassed and sometimes killed blacks and their supporters and destroyed their property. Rioters burned the home of Abby Hopper Gibbons, prison reformer and daughter of abolitionist Isaac Hopper.  newlinechar  newlinechar They also attacked white 'amalgamationists,' such as Ann Derrickson and Ann Martin, two women who were married to black men; and Mary Burke, a white prostitute who catered to black men. Near the docks, tensions that had been brewing since the mid-1850s between white longshoremen and black workers boiled over.  newlinechar  newlinechar As recently as March of 1863, white employers had hired blacks as longshoremen, with whom Irish men refused to work. An Irish mob then attacked two hundred blacks who were working on the docks, while other rioters went into the streets in search of 'all the negro porters, cartmen and laborers . . . they could find.' They were routed by the police. But in July 1863, white longshoremen took advantage of the chaos of the Draft Riots to attempt to remove all evidence of a black and interracial social life from area near the docks.  newlinechar  newlinechar White dockworkers attacked and destroyed brothels, dance halls, boarding houses, and tenements that catered to blacks; mobs stripped the clothing off the white owners of these businesses. newlinechar  newlinechar **Rioters subjected black men to the most brutal violence**: torture, hanging, and burning.  Collection of the New-York Historical Society newlinechar Black men and black women were attacked, but the rioters singled out the men for special violence.  newlinechar  newlinechar On the waterfront, they hanged William Jones and then burned his body. White dock workers also beat and nearly drowned Charles Jackson, and they beat Jeremiah Robinson to death and threw his body in the river.  newlinechar  newlinechar Rioters also made a sport of mutilating the black men's bodies, sometimes sexually. *A group of white men and boys mortally attacked black sailor William Williams—jumping on his chest, plunging a knife into him, smashing his body with stones*—while a crowd of men, women, and children watched. None intervened, and when the mob was done with Williams, they cheered, pledging 'vengeance on every nigger in New York.' newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/317749.html
&gt; Were the Germans justified in putting the Jews into camps?

You realize that website gives your result for your standing among *the entire world* right? That is nowhere relevant to what is being referred to as 'the 1%.'

Locking us in to a balanced budget goes against basic ideas of economics that I think both sides agree on. The federal government isn't like a household. I wish people would stop saying that. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually the amnesty programs of the past did fix the problem temporarily. But honestly I wasn't talking about an amnesty program as much as I was talking about actual reform of how the immigration system works. To spell out what I mean really obviously, we need to lower the barriers to becoming a citizen to almost nothing. Everyone agrees that immigrants and the first few generations who follow them are more engaged with the government of the country they move to and they work harder. Most economists suggest that making it easier to be a citizen does nothing but boost the economy.  newlinechar  newlinechar I wont speak to the Common Core issue. I don't really know enough about it to refute your points. You could be right. I just remember it had widespread support before the President started talking about it.

Untrue, organic agriculture uses far less pesticide.  Organic produce also has far less pesticide residue on it.  Stop spreading these insane lies.  The numbers DO NOT back up your claims.   newlinechar    newlinechar Organic farms are generally grown on smaller lots with more human input.  They hire workers to get rid of weeds and pests.  Yes, this can be expensive;  but growing resistance of weeds to glyphosate pesticide which is now forcing GMO farmers to crop-dust multiple times is quickly becoming more expensive than hired labour.   newlinechar    newlinechar There are natural pest deterrents that can be used also, such as concentrated oils like oregano oil and cayenne extract.  This would just require the farmer to also grow oregano and peppers along with their main food crop.   newlinechar    newlinechar The real solution though, is to move away from the current agricultural model.  We need more community farms, WAY MORE community farms.  We need permaculture, instead of utterly unsustainable monocultures.  What they don't tell you is over the long run organic actually outperforms conventional in yields because synthetic fertilizer + repeated pesticide soakings kill the soil.  We need a self replenishing permaculture model that incorporates a variety of crops on a plot of soil.  A tall growing crop incorporated with a shade loving crop, a susceptible crop incorporated with a crop that drives away pests, funghi farms to help recycle the soil, etc.  All this should be done by a union of farmers who have the final say on their food, NOT some fucking chemical company.  If a crop fails within the union it won't matter, because the abundance created by thousands of farmers working together will more than make up for the loss.  No more greed fueled, self serving, paranoid capitalist farming.  Why do current farmers put so much pesticide on their crops?  Because if their crop fails they'll go bankrupt and their family will be destroyed.  It's not the farmer's fault they exist in a terrible system that takes advantage of them.  Monsanto makes $9 billion in profit a year and the farmers they've made slaves of can barely make a living, it should be the other way around!
&gt; Free energy also has evidence to support it's theory newlinechar  newlinechar Do you have examples? 
They do if they want 0 losses and want to sacrifice Arabs instead. It also creates a divide on the ground, politically. They also get to sell more weapons.

The nutrients in farmed produce are vastly different from the nutrients in 'produce' you can freely acquire in your local wooded areas.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't personally believe any kind of real 'collapse' is imminent, as I used to.

I also grow a lot of my herbs and make my own jelly. I get plenty of exercise and nutrition because of that paranoid delusion I used to live, so it wasn't all bad.

I read the article you posted and if it is true to the extent that the author claims, then indeed I find that information somewhat disturbing. I did notice that the article mentioned that Roundup isn't licensed to be used as a dessicant, and im sure that it is illegal to apply roundup less than 2 weeks before harvest anyways.  Also after doing a bit of reading in some farming blogs that cater to wheat farming, it sounds like it isn't very common practice at all, for the reasons I had guessed at b4, at least not in Kansas anyways.  Their estimate was that 1% of the wheat crop in the largest wheat producing state was treated with roundup in that way. As a consumer of wheat, any being treated in that way is troubling to me, and i for one wouldn't be opposed to seeing that type of practice banned, mostly because such a ban wouldn;t negatively affect my operation at all and would probably help my bottom line as it would cause a decline in planted acres and would cause a rise in commodity prices

Not everything is CNN, Fox, etc... There are real and reliable news sources available and those tend to be the ones that send their journalists into the most dangerous situations. I think the way you are attacking them for doing their job, a job that is necessary for us to even have the discussion of a conspiracy, is ridiculous, reactionary and shortsighted. No matter how much you really despise all media you cannot be hypocritical enough to deny the fact that reporting is necessary to both break the initial story as well as provide details to any potential conspiracy. Journalists are necessary and your view on them is so narrow-minded that you completely miss the fact that they are solely responsible for your ability to discuss conspiracy theories in the first place.

It's much more efficient to brainwash persons responsible for the food production of the general population than it is to brainwash the entire population into consuming a detrimental product, although, I believe both methods are used, albeit they are concentrating on different areas for each approach. Convince the population that there is nothing wrong with the product, and convince the farmers to use the product in new, creative ways...perhaps through the use of targeted advertising and cool videos.  newlinechar  newlinechar An historical example would be Edward Bernays. Sigmund Freud's nephew, Edward Bernays, the guy who convinced American women to smoke cigarettes and helped overthrow the democratically elected president of Guatemala on behalf of the United Fruit company (Chiquita), also [helped the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) find a market for Hexafluorosilicic-acid, a byproduct of aluminum production. Working on behalf of Alcoa and various special interest groups, he successfully convinced the American public that water fluoridation was safe and beneficial to human health. This was achieved by using the American Dental Association in a highly successful media campaign.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays)

You couldn't be more wrong. Discrimination is illegal because discrimination is morally wrong, regardless of the victim. You're engaging (albeit a little) in the same moral equivalency that the Left does. newlinechar  newlinechar By your logic, it's not as bad to rob/steal from someone who is wealthy as it is to rob/steal from someone who is poor. Murder is not as bad if the victim is a really bad person as compared to a good person. It's okay to slander someone who is famous because they can afford a whole PR team to mitigate false accusations. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're just meaning to say that majorities are not as hurt by discrimination as minorities, that may be true, but it's irrelevant. Traffic tickets hurt poor people more than they do rich people, so should we just let poor people get away with breaking traffic laws while only prosecuting those who can afford the fines? newlinechar  newlinechar We as a society have agreed that it is wrong to discriminate against another person for reasons of age, race, sex or national origin. It should no matter whether that age, race, sex or national origin is the minority or the majority, it should be equally illegal as well as immoral.

Are you you thinking those emails were fabricated to make it look like Alex doesn't work with them? newlinechar  newlinechar One of the AJ shows from the last 2 months, he admitted to being infiltrated, though he did not say it was Stratfor specifically. newlinechar  newlinechar So, what other 'fruits' of AJ's is rotten? What else proves he's a dastardly 'insider?' He's done more to wake up the masses than anyone else on present-day-earth. How does that serve the insiders?

This isn't true. Some drugs, particularly opiates, do have a grasp on people and strength of mind has little to do with it. You're strongest willed person may have an easier time staying off after detox, but they will be just as sick, in just as much pain, and struggle with the same imbalances caused by the changes in the brain. newlinechar  newlinechar Your brain is reliant on chemical reactions. When you start adding receptors and decreasing dopamine and seratonin output and uptake it will cause problems.

Implying call them out on the community they belong to is equivalent to all people in the community being equally guilty of those crimes. newlinechar  newlinechar And your arguments only prove my point(you just don't understand the point, or are feigning ignorance). When the US was in Iraq/over threw Libya and trying to destroy Syria completely now they are doing it in their own communities interest with no regard to anyone else, in their case for the interest of the US dollar. No, the average US citizen has no impact on those crimes and very few even understand what's going on. newlinechar  newlinechar But this also means that the people who are committing these crimes are committing a conspiracy. You can show motive through religion in this case. With the US you can point to the US dollar and economic domination of the world as a motive.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;it's not relevant in outing the crimes of the people within that community newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, it has no relevance to that. But you can establish motive for those crimes and show that a tightly knit community of that type exists and has lots of influence in powerful positions. newlinechar  newlinechar From the motive you can try to find others within that community(and some outside even) that are doing similar things and bunch them together with the rest.

All valid, but I think you're missing a subtle point. From my understanding /r/offmychest is a place to talk about what frustrates people and actually vent what they're feeling about and get to talk to people who can help you understand why you may feel this way and help you feel at least a little better. It doesn't matter that he's generalizing, but the fact that he went there for support, expecting support after they advertised support and subsequently got slammed. The fact that he went looking for support means that he acknowledged that what he felt is a generalization which is intellectually incorrect and he wants to talk about why he feels that way emotionally and work through it, not get harassed and banned.  newlinechar  newlinechar He came looking for help and wanting to change his view, but got the door slammed in his face.

yes, those 'conspiratards' will always polarize on a single claim... after all it's for most more of an ideology than genuine interest in truthful and objective information. newlinechar  newlinechar yet, maybe i am also a bit of a -tard for believing that the establishment is also not very interested in establishing genuine interest in truthful and objective information?!? newlinechar  newlinechar I think we have to think critically and immerse ourselves in all sides of the story to form our own individual position on any matter.

Ah that makes sense. 
Precisely. 
To be fair, sometimes the 'whats the conspiracy?' comments are warrented. It all really depends on the topic and how thr OP presents it to the rest of us. For instance, a poster submits a link about vaccines. Well, we all basicslly know what the conspiracy is... But if a poster submits something, for example, about geocentrism?  newlinechar  newlinechar Asking 'whats the conspiracy?' can sometimes help get the OP to go straight to the point at hand, instead of jumping around a page or watching 45min. video waiting to find out why its relevant and whether you should continue. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, one could just come up with a theory or speculation on just about anything, making just about everything relevant. But i dont think its cute to leave the rest of the folks in suspense, if 'discussion' truely is the aim. Thus, it should be clear or obvious. If not, then ask. Thats how i see it.

Agreed, this is an informative post regarding the connections between Washington DC and Corporation executives. It isn't unusual for these connections to exist as leaders in a specific industry may sell themselves as being perfect candidates for specific government positions and vice versa.

If you're a leaf laying in the roof gutter long enough, you're bound to come into contact with other leaves from the same tree. This is true in my experience working in big business and in the public school system. newlinechar  newlinechar However, the connections in this article do not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was direct collusion related to 9/11. What I do see is negligence in some of these folks' duties. newlinechar  newlinechar These connections exist, but doesn't provide a smoking gun for an inside job (if that's what the implication is). newlinechar  newlinechar Impressive game of 'Six degrees of Kevin Bacon' was had in this article.

Yep. Why are so many women so alt-med? Because we go to the doctor for legit serious issues and get told we're crazy, take a crazy pill.

You feel bad for using the punchline 'Unless they were black'? No need for that really, it's relatively innocent for IGTHFT standards.   newlinechar     newlinechar I'd say most Nazis indeed did believe jews (among **many** other minorities!) were sub-human, although some events show some of the Nazi leaders didn't believe the propaganda they fed to the people at all. It's known that Himmler was far more extreme in his ideals than Hitler was, for example, and most of the military elite wanted to concentrate more on a stronger Germany than on establishing the Nazi utopia.      newlinechar    newlinechar As for why Hitler became an anti-semite, we'll never know for sure, but when he returned to München after WW1, communists seized the municipal government's buildings and declared the [Bavarian Soviet Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic), as part of the [German Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319). Many of the communist leaders were jews.   newlinechar Hence why when the revolution was crushed by government forces and paramilitary groups (out of which the early NSDAP and her SA would evolve), many Germans suspected that the communists and jews tried to destroy Germany from within; while the communist part was true, the jewish part was a generalization.   newlinechar    newlinechar This explains the popularity of the NSDAP; their political agenda was the complete opposite of the old elite (who ruined Germany in WW1), of the communists (who wanted to overthrow the German governments) and those of the prominent jews (who mostly supported either the elite or the communists; both of which the Nazis hated).   newlinechar    newlinechar But yes, I have to add that genocides do draw attention but hardly ever draw action.

I suspect it happens far more often than we know.   newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine the number of people who have told loved ones, 'I am afraid for my life. If I end up dead -- for any reason, it was foul play.' Individual then ends up dead in an embarrassing way, such as auto-erotic asphyxiation, and the family is told, 'shut up or you're next.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Add to that the number of people who were taken out and the ruse was successful.  The press is told they had a history of depression or substance abuse, it gets 'reported' in the ~~state~~ media, family is scared so no one challenges it.   newlinechar  newlinechar I KNOW for a fact this happens because I was blatantly lied to when I was doing journalism.  Press releases often had wrong information in them about serious crimes, like, 'Police believe the perpetrator is a pedophile.'  Or, 'Witnesses reported that suspect had a large cache of firearms.' Just be aware that when you read the words, 'Investigators report' or 'Police said' that the reporter is covering their ass. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe other people are probably set up to be shipped off to prison by having child porn put on their computers, or framed for a crime they did not commit. I think the more embarrassing the crime, the better.  This is what really scares me about the NSA, they can simply make up shit about you, insert it electronically where ever it does the most damage and you literally have no defense.  'No, I didn't ever research how to build a nuclear device.' 'Then why is it in your web searches?' newlinechar  newlinechar It bothers me that people excuse this as they aren't 'important enough' to have the government target them, as if it is okay to do this to people who are more visible or outspoken. newlinechar  newlinechar I am sure that it isn't just the government, but corporations doing the same. Whistleblow that our new drug is dangerous?  Be dead in a fiery drunk driving crash. Going to expose we sold weapons to terrorists?  Arrested in a hotel room with an underage prostitute in a foreign country (so no one really knows what happened). Most people accept whatever crap the media tells them, without realizing that 90% of the news out there is spoonfed by cops, corporations and government via press releases.   newlinechar  newlinechar Investigative journalism is all but dead.
As an atheist I always found it strange when I run into others that call themselves atheists and then go crazy over all religions.   newlinechar  newlinechar If your deal is to proselytize others in a way that you've got all the answers and if others believe in god then they are nuts, you are actually part of a cult/religion. newlinechar  newlinechar It's the same thing with liberals vs. conservatives.  I really don't care what liberals believe in.  Let them live their own lives adhering to their ideology.  The problem is always the same.  People who have the need to force their belief system on others. newlinechar  newlinechar Atheists critical of the religious and liberals are no different than the muslim nuts.  They've got all the answers for all of us.

They are run by a very limited amount of people, Jews on the other hand are a large and varied crowd, it's unfair and incorrect to lump them together.

No, that was the Bromberg Massacre in which tens of thousands of ethnic Germans were brutally slaughtered by Polish partisan Jews.

A pandeist.. How novel. I happen to be a reluctant [panentheist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism). newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I found the [Orisis/Dionysus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Mysteries) theory on the origin of the Jesus allegory to be most compelling, on its surface, however failing to account for the archaeological evidence supporting the existence of a radical dissident and rabbi who purportedly attempted to reform Judaism and oppose the societal norms of the time, Jesus of Nazareth.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then you have the concept of Jesus being an incarnation of the Logos, which like the bulk of theology largely becomes a matter of 'faith' or speculation. newlinechar  newlinechar My view is Jesus of Nazareth was perhaps a combination of the above, and had arguably advocated some reasonably noble philosophies for his time. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically,[f] although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus.[19] Most scholars agree that Jesus was a Jewish rabbi from Galilee who preached his message orally,[20] was baptized by John the Baptist, and was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of the Roman prefect, Pontius Pilate.[21] Scholars have constructed various portraits of the historical Jesus, which often depict him as having one or more of the following roles: the leader of an apocalyptic movement, Messiah, a charismatic healer, a sage and philosopher, or an egalitarian social reformer.[22] Scholars have correlated the New Testament accounts with non-Christian historical records to arrive at an estimated chronology of Jesus' life.

War has changed. It's no longer about nations, ideologies or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by mercenaries and machines. War, and its consumption of life, has become a well-oiled machine. War has changed. ID tagged soldiers carry ID tagged weapons, use ID tagged gear. Nanomachines inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Genetic control. Information control. Emotion control. Battlefield control. Everything is monitored, and kept under control. War has changed. The age of deterrence has become the age of control. All in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield, controls history.

Federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr, not $11/hr.  newlinechar  newlinechar And skills mean very little in the workforce. Education is all that matters to most employers. You can have all the skills in the world, but if you don't have the right piece of paper you're going to continue working minimum wage jobs. And that paper only helps if the jobs are available at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar Skills mean next to nothing. I have ten+ years in management in the nursing field. I worked in high stress environments that required a pretty decent skill set that could be applied to any office or management job. But when I moved and have to wait on transfers etc I looked for a job outside the field and did not qualify for anything but minimum wage all because I don't have a bachelor's; I went through an accelerated program straight to nursing.

This isn't true.  Karaite Judaism has claimed ancestry from Khazars for generations.  It's true that Khazar converts were absorbed by neighboring communities, and it's also true that the remnants of Khazarian Judaism migrated west establishing Jewish communities in Poland, among others areas. The 'Rhineland Hypothesis' of German-Jewish migration eastward requires a nonsensical 'super-breeding' event to justify the subsequent population of Eastern European Jews.  Are all Ashkenazi Jews 'Khazars'?  Of course not.  Khazaria itself was composed of many ethnic groups.  Middle Eastern Jews had migrated there prior to the Khazar conversion while others were brought in by the nobility in the establishment of synagogues.  Nice try pretending Sand is the only historian to touch this stuff.  Everything he says about Khazars is taken from the works of other professional historians.  Re: DNA?

She doesn't have to want it...
Thank you for a true conspiracy comment instead of just attacking the publicly presented facts, I find this discussion more interesting, even if not true it is at least possible that evidence is being hidden or such from the public but anyway on to my discussion. newlinechar I wasn't very well informed on the smoking agrument you made but with a quick Google search I found this in an Oxford journal article 'The link between the smoking of cigarettes and lung cancer began to be suspected by clinicians in the 1930s when they noted the increase of this “unusual” disease. Publications began to appear and about 2 decades later the role of smoking as causative agent had been firmly established. A case control study was published in 1940 in Germany and its author flatly stated that “the extraordinary rise in tobacco use was the single most important cause of the rising incidence of lung cancer” (Müller, 1940).' They do admit however it did take a long time for the truth to be accepted.  So it is entirely possible that GMOs are a similar case, but that's hard to say right now, both sides need to be researched by each of us and then each individual should form an opinion, that's really what I'm advocating here. newlinechar  newlinechar As for why the fight against labeling, it's entirely possible they're doing it because of some hidden danger.  But it seems to me that the more likely answer is money.  Many people fight against GMOs and have caused public opinion to be very split on the subject, if things were labeled GMO a given company could be losing 50% or more of its consumer base hurting profits.  Am I against labeling?  No, that'd be fine with me, I'd buy it regardless, but as I paraphrased Neil deGrasse Tyson elsewhere ITT, most foods are already genetically modified in old school selective breeding so a lab GMO label and breeding GMO label would be more fair IMO.
&gt; if a business has freedom to pay their workers whatever they want (ie no minimum wage) then workers will be forced into wage slavery, and labor freedom will be diminished. newlinechar  newlinechar Only 4.3% of workers are paid at or below minimum wage levels (only 2.1% of full time workers). Clearly employers are willing to pay the overwhelming majority of workers more (US workers make $39,515 / year in disposable income per capita ... over 3x what a full time minimum wage worker would earn in disposable income). [Total compensation also tends to rise with productivity](http://i.imgur.com/SGiANk3.png). This is largely because employers have to compete with other employers to acquire labor. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Similarly 'government spending,' 'fiscal freedom' and 'freedom from corruption' are contradictory, the government must (in theory) spend money in order to regulate in order to prevent corruption. newlinechar  newlinechar Empirically this doesn't appear to be true, even in [low income countries](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2399710). And why would increasing spending necessarily prevent corruption? Rent seeking is a huge part of the political process that tends to lead to increased spending on special interest groups / businesses. If you could cut spending across the board, it seems this would tend to lessen the ability for politicians to direct spending to rent seeking groups.
Oh my god yes.  Can you imagine if 51% of the people really could dictate life for the other 49%?   newlinechar  newlinechar I wish more people knew the US is truly a constitutional republic.  Big difference. newlinechar

I was going to reply to the other person who replied to my comment but it appears they deleted their comment so I'll reply to you instead. The person asked why we couldn't just change the parties so here is my response to that. In short, there is a ton of money making sure that the parties don't change. Here is the long version: newlinechar  newlinechar It would be incredibly hard to change a party. The two parties each have a centralized organization that keeps all of the politicians in the party in line and on the same page. The Republicans have the GOP and the Democrats have the DNC. Both organizations take in enormous amount of money in donations and they are literally always having fundraisers to raise even more money to keep up with each other. Each organization decides which candidates receive the official party endorsement. Along with the endorsement, the chosen candidates at all levels of government receive enormous amounts of money to use to fund their campaigns so that they can keep up with the opposing party's campaign. If they don't have as much money as the other candidate they likely won't get as many billboards, TV commercials, mail flyers, etc which can mean the difference between winning and losing a race. Without the party endorsement and the cash that comes with it, it is very hard for candidates to get their name and their message out there so it is almost always just two candidates, one from each party, that dominate each race. Once elected, if a politician does not 'vote with the party' enough they stand to lose the party endorsement meaning that the party will back a different candidate when reelection time comes which makes it less likely that a candidate will win their reelection. Both the GOP and the DNC use this tactic to try to keep politicians in their party in line and voting the way they want them to vote. It doesn't always work however since incumbents have a huge advantage in any election regardless whether the have the party endorsement or not so politicians know they have a little wiggle room. Crossing the party though is still not a good idea because if the entire party turns their back on you, they will likely vote to kill any legislation you introduce and the opposing party isn't likely to be friendly to you either since you ran as a member of the other party. So you could end up being seen as a politician who can't get anything passed which may cost you your reelection.  newlinechar  newlinechar Primaries do exist and there is a saying in American politics that 'real democracy takes place in the primaries' which is true. Voter turn-out in primaries is very low however and it's usually people who are very loyal to the party who show up to vote so the end result is almost always that you get two 'typical' party-loyal candidates. The primaries are also party-specific and usually closed meaning that at Republican primaries, for example, Republicans run against each other and only registered Republicans can vote in that primary. The same goes for Democratic primaries. Those who are neither registered as Republicans nor Democrats cannot vote in either set of primaries. This also encourages the election of party-loyal politicians since the people who choose the candidates are already registered party members so they are likely to be party-loyal themselves.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tl;dr: The GOP and the DNC pour tons of money into American politics to ensure that candidates that agree with the prescribed party-line get elected.

Haha if you use snopes as your guide to what is and isn't false, you're going to end up being wrong about a lot of things.  Do you actually know anything about snopes?  Who runs it, who funds it, who researchers the topics and are they qualified to answer?  Or do you just take it all in good faith?

Tor is used for *privacy*. That's its main focus. Privacy means its frequently used for illicit acts but its main function is privacy against bad government. For example, during the spring revolutions Tor was one of the main applications which allowed communication outside of the country as the governments were blocking most traffic. Of course, at some periods even Tor didn't work. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why governments dislike Tor. That said, there are vulnerabilities and the NSA owns many exit nodes allowing for traffic analysis. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Tor is not considered a trusted environment against the US Government. newlinechar

&gt;Zero: That’s the percent of children suffering from attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, a neurologist said in his new book, “ADHD Does Not Exist: The Truth About Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Author Richard Saul said that over the course of his long career, and treatment of patients complaining of problems related to short attention spans and an inability to focus, he’s come to one conclusion: ADHD is only a collection of symptoms, not a disease or disorder in itself. It shouldn’t be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, he said, The New York Post reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The number of ADHD diagnoses has increased in recent years simply because doctors are failing to probe deeply enough and question patients about related health matters — and because ADHD has become an embraced, accepted catch-all diagnosis, he said. And more bluntly: Mr. Saul said parents seek an easy way to get their children to sit down and shut up, and the treatments for ADHD — Adderall and Ritalian — do the trick. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But those drugs are dangerous and addictive stimulants, and they shouldn’t be prescribed so cavalierly, he said. For instance, one in nine children are now labeled as ADHD, and two thirds of them have been put on a stimulant, The New York Post reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“ADHD makes a great excuse,” Mr. Saul said, The New York Post reported. “The diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults. It can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, rather than stuck in a boring rut.” newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/6/adhd-fake-disorder-neurologist-turned-author-says/

I don't think you understood what I was talking about, and you didn't answer the question you quoted. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I, for example, think that the best way to achieve peace and prosperity for all mankind on this beautiful planet of ours we will be forced to share for quite a few millennia still is by getting rid of all the lies and taboos that were fabricated to keep everyone in place (divided, that is), and if only for the simple reason that then the idiot racists - be they black or white or brown or pink with yellow and green stripes - would have no ground to stand on anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar So stop talking about racism and it will go away? yeah, that doesn't work. Honestly I'm not even sure what you're talking about. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I think we should all live in peace and harmony, and all I said is true except that I'm European, 'white', with Asian, Frisian, and (just maybe) Jewish ancestors mixed in many generations ago.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is a nice wish but racism exists. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;People should be free to share information about history without being called names. If the information is false, debunk it, so it can go down the sewers of oblivion and background noise. If it is correct, adjust your world view or be stubborn, and carry on. Why make claims that everyone who isn't ashamed of being white or black or brown or pink with blue and magenta stripes is automatically racist? newlinechar  newlinechar I didnt say any of that. I said people who say 'white pride' are all racist. I've never talked to a person who wasn't a racist who was proud of being 'white', whatever that means. I have no problem with peopel taking pride in being a *minority* or *nation*. But white isn't a thing. newlinechar  newlinechar I have no idea how a 'I don't see race' person ended up on a thread about Jews. But yeah I have no idea what you're even trying to say here. newlinechar  newlinechar White pride is a term used by white supermacists exclusively. Gay pride, as a counter example, is not often used by bigots. So ... yeah, historical context matters.

In the 1800s, Natives were forced to become American citizens, to give up their barbaric ways and assimilate into American society. This led to a lot of interracial mixing, especially in the Midwest. A great many people who have ancestry in the US predating the 1800s have a bit of native blood in them due to this period. That's why it is incredibly rare to find a pure blooded Native and why the most common are quarters, eighths, and sixteenths. I am also a product of this.
I cannot understand how two people having the government legally acknowledge their union affects anyone else in a non religious way.

If Mormons want to abstain from alcohol, fine. If a Christian wants to abstain from a gay sex act, fine. I just don't think those religious beliefs should impinge upon someone else's right to do those things. Especially since nobody is injured. If a lot of religious traditions say gay marriage is forbidden, my feeling is that those people don't have to have a gay marriage. newlinechar  newlinechar Is there an argument against gay marriage that is not based in religion?

I believe people who are tech savvy and who have been concerned about this for sometime, understand the gravity of the situation, as far as the world and the 'internet' goes.  newlinechar  newlinechar The propaganda is really bad. The disinfo is strong. So is it so out of the question, to consider that someone has seen /r/conspiracy , and people who are willing to believe in conspiracy 'theories' as people who can be presented enough information to overload them?  newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, if it's a sort of PSYOP (and what isn't these days? sickening really) , it is an interesting one. Drawing out lots of different responses from lots of different people. I can't really say anything other than what I take to be evidence that this IS a sort of Hundred Flowers Campaign of sorts... and that a lot of what we see on the internet... is. newlinechar  newlinechar The allegations against the 'enlightened' is that they are trying to use any means necessary to advance human intelligence and life, progress, awareness.

Interesting question. I was exagerating of course, I would never knowingly vote for Satan. But since you asked... I believe he's actually called the 'prince of lies' and the 'father of the lie' because he told the first lie (that Adam and Eve would not die) and brought lying into the world. Not because everything he said is a lie (he also said they would gain the knowledge of good and bad, which they did). So in the sense of not being able to trust him, he's very similar to a lot of politicians today.

Thanks.  Will give a listen. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: newlinechar  newlinechar Having listened to the podcast, I’d say Stephen Bassett is on the up and up.  I might not agree with everything 100% he’s said, but he’s a legitimate researcher that doesn’t seem to be  newlinechar into disinformation. newlinechar  newlinechar Regardless, however, it doesn’t really matter whether he is or isn’t “legitimate” (although, again, he does appear to be legitimate to me), as ET existence is REAL.  I personally don’t worry too much about the minutia or who is or isn’t “real” because I have a pretty strong understanding myself and on my own - independent of any other external individual - that regardless of what anyone says, the existence of ETs on and around planet Earth is in fact a reality.  Outside information doesn't validate or invalidate it one way or the other because I’ve had personal experiences that give me a good idea about the bigger picture in general.  Do some people have a closer idea than others?  Sure.  Of course.  Do I put people like Stephen Bassett and Steven Greer in the realm of “disinformation agents”?  Not at all, and there hasn’t been as far as I’ve seen any good, justifiable real reason for people to see them as that.
I too grew up on a farm. We raised cattle and pigs. 95% of the bales of hay that we used were round and had to be moved by a skid loader or tractor. The only small bales we had was straw and it was like one week out of the year that we threw them and that wasn't even a workout.

Let's be honest, the Muslim faith is also nooooot doing a whole lot of good for themselves. EG, Saudi Arabia beheading people for witchcraft. I feel like we as Westerners are more invested in the Israeli / Jewish side of things because we are exposed to so much of their propaganda and told they must not be criticized, etc, however the reality in my opinion is that it is a complex issue where a large majority of the Muslim nations are quite backwards when it comes to Western sensibilities.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, whether you want to explore the fact that Western intelligence funds the most extreme and outrageous forms of Islam to continue to bat at the hornets nest and never see any peace occur in this region, well that is up to you. It is a complex issue, not in that it is complex whether Israel is 'wrong' in their actions, I would argue that their actions are unconscionable, genocidal, evil and barbaric, and if it comes down to 'does Israel have a right to exist' I would at this point say they do not based on their behavior and inability to cooperate with their neighbors and disregard for world opinion and common decency.

Jen has 5 kids. She tells the state she has a minimum wage job, so she needs them to give her money for child care.  newlinechar  newlinechar They say, alright, well, lets see the proof you have this job. newlinechar  newlinechar Her friend Tony has a business, he cuts her checks each week as if she works there, but she doesn't. Maybe she gives it back to him, who knows. But she shows the checks to the state who eventually says, alright, this is legit, you make so little that you qualify for 200$ per kid per week to pay for child care, let us know who to give it to. newlinechar  newlinechar The last person in the scam is Linda. She runs 'Day Care 666', which is not real. Jen tells the state that she sends her kids to Day Care 666, and the state cuts Linda 200$ a week per kid that goes there. newlinechar  newlinechar Only Linda's not really watching the kids, so she's just netting 1000$ a week for nothing (maybe they're just with their mom or something).  newlinechar  newlinechar You can see how with a few different people in on it, this could become VERY lucrative. My little example with only 20 kids would be netting 4000$ a week, that's $208,000 a year.
&gt; It's your kid, you should be able to name him/her anything you want.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know. Nutella is not too bad, but what about a really extreme name like 'Abortion Gone Wrong' or 'Cuntflaps'? newlinechar  newlinechar Children are not their parent's 'property' after all, but individuals with their own legal rights, and there are times when, sadly, the state has to step in and assert a child's rights on the child's behalf, against the wishes of the parents/guardians. It's just a question of where you draw the line, in my view. newlinechar  newlinechar Don't get me wrong, I think an adult should be able to change their name to literally anything they want, and maybe this girl will elect to call herself 'Nutella' when she grows up, although somehow I doubt it!

&gt;They EDUCATE themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar This is such a bullshit regurgitated response built out of nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-15/grads-remake-china-workforce-as-high-end-threat-to-u-s- newlinechar  newlinechar In 2014, China had 7 million college graduates. That means in less than 3 years, China has had more college grads than the entire Jewish population in the world. How is it then, that the Chinese make such a significantly smaller dent in global capital than Jews? If it is solely based on 'valuing education'? newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, that top 3 countries with the most college educated per year are Canada, Japan, and Russia. newlinechar  newlinechar So those 3 countries apparently just don't work hard enough or do it right. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.forbes.co.il/rating/list.aspx?en6v0tVq=FK newlinechar  newlinechar 11% of the total Billionaires in the world are Jews. In fact, when you look at the micro of it, 20% of the under 40 billionaires are Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar Education does not equate to wealth. If it did, those numbers would be skewed towards Russians, Japanese, and Canadian billionaires. Alas, they aren't. You explain to me how 16 million people disproportionately have such a swath of capital. And its not education, that is the lamest most political correct propaganda you could pull out. That is false, and proven false with statistics. The population of Canada+Russia+Japan 305 million. Somehow that mysterious 16 million just does better per capita yet is less educated. Any other points? newlinechar  newlinechar Let me seriously drive this home to those people who don't understand it in small numbers: newlinechar  newlinechar There are about 1400 billionaires in the world. Out of those 1400, approx. 10% are Jews. So that means 140. newlinechar  newlinechar 140 people out of 16 million - you have a 0.00000875 of ending up being a billionaire as a Jew. newlinechar This leaves the remaining billionaires - 1240 out of a total population of approx. 7 billion. So if you're NOT a Jew, you have a 0.0000001771428571 chance of being a billionaire. Let's compare: newlinechar  newlinechar 0.00000875 = Jewish billionaire probability newlinechar  newlinechar 0.00000017 = Rest of the world's probability  newlinechar  newlinechar Right. That makes sense. Because they are less educated per capita than other people in the world they are an n'th degree more chance at becoming a billionaire. 
That seems to imply that you've gained some great wisdom I lack which let you see the truth in this issue. I think it's wholly probable that physical scientists are more qualified than both of us, and the majority of them see a problem as well. (unless you are in fact one, in which case that would be rather useful to mention)
I believe you're asking the wrong question.  It's backwards to start with a framework and try to plug our current healthcare system into it.  If you really want to address the problems, you need to create your goals, lay out your current problems/inadequacies, and propose solutions to those problems. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see any one system working for the entire population.  For example, I feel a free market system might work for those in the 0-45 year old group.  For those with chronic disease and the elderly, a socialized system probably fits better. newlinechar  newlinechar At the start of my career, I was fully entrenched as a free market in medicine supporter but as time goes on, I become less and less confident that it can work.  The alternative medicine market has broken me of my faith in the free market.  In alternative medicine, the price of treatments are increasing and NONE of it works.  It's a multi billion dollar industry with it's foundation completely entrenched in defrauding people.  The free market is supposed to find an equilibrium and make these types of fraudulent activities unfavorable but a majority of the population has bought into it and is willingly spending money for poor outcomes.

I'm from Wisconsin and voted for Walker. I love what he is doing for the state. He does have some bad history though. It might be the same as other politicians, but I don't know. For instance, he 'left' Marquette (I go there, nothing against the institution except their recent decisions about gay marriage) because of potential fraud during student elections. I'm pretty sure he's not a college graduate. Not saying a college degree is necessary, but running for president, it could matter. Also, the recall, even though he won, still makes him look controversial. Finally, the 'John Doe' investigations don't shine him in the best light. I'd love for him to win, but he has a history that is easy to attack. Also, there's family matters.

The situation in N. Korea is maybe a bit too extreme/special to even call left in my opinion, it's really a wringing of blood from the stone by the ruling party in the same sense as authoritarian Arab nations. newlinechar  newlinechar Venezuela is probably one of the best modern examples of failed socialism. If your entire country subsists on a single, government-controlled resource, it's not a good idea to centralize the well-being of your citizens around the government. newlinechar  newlinechar Alberta, Canada (heavily reliant on oil prices) experienced a similar economic disaster (on a less severe scale obviously) with the drop in oil prices. They've since elected a more left government and the economy has improved along with oil prices.  newlinechar  newlinechar The more extreme the partisanship and social divide gets in North America the more I feel like we need to stop conflating social and economic policy with each other. A lot of social policy from the left is economically ignorant (speaking as a Canadian, BC is trying to block pipelines to our coast right now) and a lot of economic policy from the right is really harmful on an individual level (the Medicaid bill trying to go through right now in the States, I think is fair to call more of an economic policy than a social one). There are a lot of examples vice-versa too, of course. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm starting to really hate directive descriptors when it comes to governance.

&gt;Except it doesn't. The state discriminates regularly against different classes of people. A person making $200k/year is ineligible for food stamps. Violence against police officers is punished more severely than violence against ordinary people. newlinechar  newlinechar Those aren't good examples of unequal protection.  newlinechar  newlinechar The food stamp law is applied equally to all people. Those who are eligible for food stamps will no longer be eligible for food stamps if they no longer fit the criteria.  newlinechar  newlinechar The police law also applies equally to all people. Anyone who commits violence against a police officer is subject to the same treatment as anyone else who commits violence against a police officer. The special protection also applies to all police officers, regardless of race, sex, age, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar In both those cases, it is the person's choices and not their immutable characteristics that determine their special designation. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Supreme Court has developed a whole line of cases dealing with this. newlinechar  newlinechar You're right, the Supreme Court does have a hierarchy of protected classes. Age is under the category of 'rational basis' scrutiny, meaning that in order to discriminate based on age, there must be a 'rational reason related to a legitimate government interest'. There is no rational reason or government interest to apply murder laws any differently based on age. If anything there is a rational and legitimate government interest in the special protection of the child because the government has an interest in producing the next generation of citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Murder is, but not all homicides are murder. Self defense exists, as do a number of other defenses. In the case of self defense we place the right of the innocent victim over the right of the perpetrator. If we accept abortion as a right under the guise of 'privacy' then it must, almost by necessity, outweigh the life interest of the child. Because abortion requires destroying that interest. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with the self-defense analogy, when applied to abortion, is that it removes the blame from the mother for getting pregnant. A better analogy would be inviting someone over to your house and shooting them when they arrive. The guest has a reasonable belief that they are allowed on your property because you made the choice to invite them over. In 99% of cases, the mother made a choice to have unprotected sex, and it is her responsibility to understand the implications of that choice.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And that is why it is not enough to build up the right of children to live. We need to take down the legal argument that abortion is a right. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with that wholeheartedly. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Clarified the police case

I believe in the spiritual realm. Some people don't, but the elites do. They believe they are in contact with some powerful entities, and that is what drives their behavior. It actually explains a lot. They believe they draw power from these things, but fail to realize that some entities are stronger than others. Luckily, we're on the good side, that is much more powerful. The more of us that realize this, the better off our movement will be. newlinechar  newlinechar I've had experiences of my own, it's pretty incredible and I don't expect the internet to believe me, but there's a spiritual battle happening and Trump is being used to do a global reset for good.

Pretty much all those links are to news articles, not actual peer reviewed research, so again you are being deliberately disingenuous. newlinechar  newlinechar The climate affects the entire planet and is at the root out agriculture and a lot of basic human culture (and has been since the beginning of out species).  Its not surprising that it will have a lot of effects.  If you weren't a troll it'd also be obvious to you that different places will be effected differently. newlinechar  newlinechar Also most of those links have conditional words like 'may' or 'could.'  They're hypotheses, ie the things scientists are going to investigate, not some sort of unquestionable dogma, no matter what sort of strawperson you've created in your head.

If you think telling me to 'fuck off' or suggesting that talking about sensitive topics within this group is going to make me go away, then you're mistaken. It's the reasons that you have stated that are exactly why I keep engaging with others in this group: because no topic or idea is sacred enough to not criticize or discuss in a critical manner.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you say that I'm working to produce change in the mind of another person, you are intentionally misrepresenting my original comment, in which I stated BOTH parties are impacted by the ideas presented in the conversation. This includes my own views - I am open to changing my stance on any issue if you present me with a sound enough argument.  newlinechar  newlinechar You also are under the impression that I'm solely only interested in conversation that involves debate/argumentation, which is also not true. If someone wants to approach me to just discuss a topic, and would request for me to specifically not criticize, analyze, or insert my own opinions on the manner, then by all means I will happily partake in such an exchange.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes - I have judged people's opinions to be gross exaggerations, and I have offered insight into why I believe that those opinions are misrepresentative of reality. I fail to see why that's a negative thing, and would not deny that I've been part of such conversations. So no, I'm not downplaying this reality.   newlinechar  newlinechar Also, you have failed to point out any specific example of how I've been offensive to others (and no - I do not count your claim that I have been 'dense' to be offensive).

A third of their 'articles' (2 pages screen on Chrome/IE ) is already a pasting of 6 tweets of the reactions against DJT announcements. The heading is decided by their Narrative machine. Another half is just angry rant that's even of lower quality than our free discussions here. Only about 100 words of 'news' are plugged inside their long rant of little relevance.   newlinechar  newlinechar I mean I imagined long rants about another person having 2 scoops of ice cream to be exactly the work and emotional maturity of a middle school girl after her classmate boyfriend dumped her. And then 'it' happened. newlinechar  newlinechar In journalism, if they fact check sources, make factual anecdotes and do research their long article should take a day. Instead their articles read like lazy stuff their copy-pasted and added in some rants that sounds that they only work 2 hours a day. The only thing they consistently do above us are spell-check.

The Jews are God's chosen people (source: the Old Testament). Satan has used many a person to try to wipe them off the face of the earth. God has promised to always keep a remnant alive.

I'm not exacly a student of Islam but from what I understand it is the Koran in the early parts are similar to the Bible, but as time went on and they added to the book, it gets more violent.

MGK has probably one of the most loyal fan bases, it's cool how he genuinely cares about his fans unlike Ariana grande.

I think their point is that Trump was given everything he has, so developing real estate is easy and doesn't take that much when you start with the money and knowledge inherited from your father. And also that him being a great real estate developer has literally no worth in his presidency. He could be able to sell igloo's in Texas for all most people care but that won't make him a good President.

I don't buy it. The pronunciation listed on Google Translate is 'sawf faqaf' that's not even really close to 'covfefe'. Romanized Arabic doesn't even use the letter C. Hard C would be K or Q. Soft C would be S. 'س' is always romanized as S.

Yeah if you follow the link to google translate, it first transliterated the English word into an approximate Arabic phrase 'sof fuqof', sof simple being the future tense 'I will', and 'fa qaaf fa' meaning stand up.  Since cuvfefe has no glottal 'qaaf' sound in it, this is merely a mistake of google translates original transliteration and it doesn't mean what the English phase says at the bottom.
Wouldn't shock me the way things have been as of late.
Ah I get it. Never interrupt your enemies when they are making a mistake!
Lol I don't have an issue with people who don't like weed. If they don't want it around them, that's cool and I won't smoke around those people. What I don't like is when people insult me for doing it myself or with other friends at home. And it's always either people who have never tried it before (in which case they don't know enough about it to say whether I should or shouldn't) or people who were stoners back in the day (in which case why should they be able to have all the fun and then tell me not to lol).  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm honestly pretty liberal when it comes to most drugs but I understand people not liking them. Weed though is hardly a 'drug' in my opinion and some people need more education on it.

&gt;I didn't read the actual 7 pages, but it was apparent on the day of the release that it concerned molestation charges. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm going to take your word for it that you didn't read the indictment. newlinechar  newlinechar That said, maybe you should read it. It's not that many words (the double spaced font and the margins are huge). newlinechar  newlinechar The indictment was for the unlawfully structured payments.

Don't you think they would have mentioned what his misconduct was if they knew it at the time? newlinechar  newlinechar The wikipedia paragraphs you link/quote reference multiple sources, none point to the public knowing the nature of the misconduct when that email was sent. newlinechar  newlinechar But your own quote omits the clearly stated: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The indictment charged Hastert with unlawfully structuring the withdrawal of... newlinechar  newlinechar Regardless, **anyone could have made that comment in the email.** Friend or foe.

Thanks for such a great post. The desperation is definitely noticeable, and I also consider this a very good sign. The thread I included in my third edit contains posts from shill whistleblowers, and I recommend checking it out. It shows that these people are normal humans who are in difficult situations trying to make a living. But after awhile, they realized how they were being used for unethical purposes, and they eventually turned. I expect many more will follow suit in the future. The people are tired of being lied to, and the deceit is no longer sustainable. It'll come crashing down eventually

Sure, because they're saving them for themselves. /s...? newlinechar  newlinechar Trump and his crew haven't lifted a finger to look into this stuff - possibly because they're too busy deflecting their own investigations and bad press, but more likely because Trump just doesn't give a damn now that the election is over.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd wager the likelihood of the DNC facing any sort of repercussions for their shenanigans at 0%...

Heh.  I had a similar experience.  We live next to a house where the Mormon kids have to go to do their 'evangelizing'.  So we'd regularly get a couple (always two, male) young guys knocking at the door.  We always gave them the snide, 'go away' attitude until one day I was like, 'why?  They're kids, they're doing what their told, let's not be a dick.'   newlinechar  newlinechar So, being as I've studied MANY religions I decided to see what they were all about.  We invited them in.  They talked about their book (more about their philosophy, little about the religion) and left us with some pamphlets and the book of Mormon.   newlinechar  newlinechar A few weeks later they were back, but I was out trying to sight in my .22 air-gun.  I offered to let them take a shot, but they said they couldn't use 'weapons' due to their religion.  (Would love to see some certain other religions take up that mantra.)  I debated with them that the gun was little more than a toy, and improving one's skills with a toy was hardly against their religion.  (Yeah yeah, I read it.  Doesn't mean I bought into any of it.)   newlinechar  newlinechar They agreed, and the three of us spent the afternoon plinking at filled soda cans and having a fucking blast.  Then one mentioned having problems with his bike that I offered to help with.  (I'm mechanically inclined.)   newlinechar  newlinechar A few days later they returned with bike in tow, but alas I couldn't figure out the new gear systems on these bikes, and couldn't help them.  Talked with the boys a bit more about other religious philosophies, and had a good evening and bid them farewell.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's been over a year now, and I've seen other kids come and go from their house, but haven't been bothered by them since.  I actually miss those kids.  Well spoken, well educated, mature, and crazy respectful.   newlinechar  newlinechar I may not agree with their religion, but if the bulk of kids coming out of it start out like those two, I've no beef with it at all.

Fair enough in principle.  I'd say though that the government is not pushing acknowledgement of anthropogenic climate change, but in fact the opposite.  Four of the last six Presidents have been deniers.  Despite the PR gestures Obama threw at his base, his substantive actions did not indicate he understood or believed contemporary climate science, else he would have pushed green jobs, not massively promoted international fracking and domestic oil production, and would not have sabotaged the attempt at a binding international agreement (Copenhagen) in favor of a relatively meaningless feel-good voluntary agreement (Paris).  In addition, for 3/4 of both the Clinton and Obama presidencies Congress, which never gets attention equal to its power and importance, was controlled by deniers. newlinechar  newlinechar To your second point I'd say letting global warming go unaddressed is the greater threat to your freedom and wealth than the measures to address it would be.  Climate change is going to destroy tremendous amounts of wealth globally, from the flooded coastal regions, increased droughts and storms, mass migrations, extinctions, and food chain disruptions that it will induce.  The longer we put it off the more expensive mitigation and adaptation will be.  That also impacts freedom, as the longer we put things off, the quicker we'll need to change to avert catastrophe, and thus the more coercion might be used to bring that change about.  [Just compare the slopes of the different mitigation curves on this chart.](http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/i/global_mitigation_curves.png) newlinechar  newlinechar I've got nothing against skepticism, but at a certain point skepticism should argue for taking precautions, ever if you're uncertain about the extent of the danger.

While 'not being murdered' is not an enumerated right, it is clearly illegal in every municipality within the United States (and one could argue it is certainly viable under the 9th Amendment - as was privacy, as well as being listed in the non-binding Declaration).  Unless of course, you're suggesting that one could reasonably argue in front of the Supreme Court that not being murdered isn't a right... I'd hate to be the lawyer arguing that case.  In which instance, laws punishing murderers would be Unconstitutional.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at the Roe V.

That's what I was saying.  And CNN probably didn't contact Cato.  Cato knew that CNN would publish this since it is anti-Trump and sent it to them.  I would imagine the editor at CNN has thousands of op-eds to go through everyday.  People looking to get something published know they have a good shot at CNN if what they say is negative about Trump.  Cato would never have submitted a story like this to CNN if there was a dimocrat proposing the exact same thing.  They would have sent it to Fox, and they would have published it.

I don't think that's the experience that *most* people have, or necessarily. It's just the narrative of the day, the nursery rhyme about how high school or college are supposed to be.  newlinechar  newlinechar Like, if you watch TV or read papers or whatever, it seems like every fucking person is the hero quarterback. Or the hero quarterback's story is the only one that matters. But there are all the other players, coaches, people who collect their dirty jocks, the band members, people not good enough to make the band... and all of those are real, live people having a life while everyone's watching the quarterback. And those people are funny and cool and interesting and all feel like they're not as good as that one fucking QB, I guess you call him Chad, and his gorgeous girlfriend.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's not healthy and it's not true. Not everyone is bouncing off each other, and, for those who are, it's not all it's cracked up to be. I had sex in high school, and I almost killed myself when my girlfriend slept with someone else.  newlinechar  newlinechar But then time passed, I met other people, she wanted me back, I wouldn't take her and now I've got a family and a good life and none of it would've happened if I'd cared just a little bit more about that dumb girl almost 30 years ago and actually killed myself. And I'm actually really good friends with that girl now. She went through a divorce and barely managed to have a kid before the clock ran out.  newlinechar  newlinechar Before her, when I was in 8th grade, I was fat, wore braces, and cried when I went to bed after going to the roller skating rink and getting laughed at when I tried to talk to girls.  newlinechar  newlinechar When I was in 11th grade, I looked better and almost killed myself over that girl.  newlinechar  newlinechar Point being, I was broken. And I was gonna be broken at that roller rink or while having sex with that girl, and it took me coming to terms with myself for it to get better. And that took literally 20 more years. I wasn't that QB, I wasn't the best in the world and I wasn't the worst, and that had to be okay.  newlinechar  newlinechar I like playing videogames more than football. So I found people who liked to play videogames. And in real life, there are actually more people who like videogames than football. There are way more 5/10s, 6, 7, 8s than there are 10s. And those people tend to be more interesting.  newlinechar  newlinechar You should watch The Breakfast Club. Or watch it again.

I agree, the fact he thinks he has any credibility left is stunning. Not just from the way the HRC investigation was handled but I also have a big problem with the FBI taking over a notorious dark web CP site, increasing traffic &amp; speed and leaving it up for 2 weeks before shutting it down. I understand their intent (I hope) was to take over the site long enough to identify as many users on the site from all over the world as possible. In addition to the ethical and moral issues of conducting such an operation, the worst part is (the main people who ran the site) they ended up slithering out of charges/prison just because the FBI didn't want to disclose in court how they managed to trace these people to their real life names/locations/bypassed the anonymity of Tor. Other than that being a gross miscarriage of justice, at the end of the day what was the point of them taking over the site for that long to identify people if they knew eventually they'd be required to explain the methods &amp; tech used? Ultimately knowing they'd rather let sick child abusers,rapists, and pedos go free than disclose the means they used to identify them.  newlinechar The director (former or current) of anything that lets that happen, has no credibility to me to begin with, but you don't hear about any of that on the news...

Well I guess you still don't understand that when I say 'ugly autist' I am not actually attacking anyone. For some reason you refuse to understand that I am not trying to be rude. And I'm not self-loathing, as far as I know. I just don't understand how visually repulsive and mentally impaired members of society find their SO's. It's a shame that instead of attempting to enlighten me with your experiences as an autistic person you lash out at me. I think this is a very good example about the type of bullying that virgin males receive in this society. We must automatically be seen as self-loathing lepers that should be shunned. I would not think that an autist would be prone to bully, but it seems that incels are fair game to everyone.

great post - just as an aside, I have an answer for 'why is globalism bad' -  newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to other problems, the reason globalism is an absolute no-go for me and for any other person who cherishes liberty and freedom is that it is inherently a system of 'taxation without representation'. newlinechar  newlinechar With nationalism , you get national/local elections (or at least accountability to your national leaders) - your voice is **in theory** counted, you are represented, the laws you live by come from you and those representing you in a political process you can help shape. newlinechar  newlinechar With globalism, the true masters are behind the scenes puppetmasters (corps and super-rich elite) and their appointees, often secret, and have zero accountability. Look at how the EU works right now. The elected legislature is window dressing who rubber stamps everything (which most people dont realize). The real laws that matter are enacted (proposed) by the (12? not sure)  member 'commission', who are 'appointed' - IOW the people are rules over as serfs.  THATS what you get with globalism.  One world government means a shadow, puppet government where your opinions matter not, u are but a slave.  It wont be represented honestly of course, thats what leftists always do, rule by either force or deception. newlinechar  newlinechar But the political sides here arent what most people think they are.  It is the left vs anyone else, thats true. But the left is all about ONE thing ultimately - totalitarian power and control over everything and dominion over every one. In deed AND in thought.  This is why leftists ally with sharia supremacists.  Same mindset. And globalism aligns perfectly.

The comment chains are bots, they just change up what they say, manually type up a new chain sometimes, and go back every now and then and manually respond to people that waste time responding to their tweets so it looks like they're actually humans. newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, though, the best way to mess with the twitter algorithm (as told to them, most likely, but the admins at twitter) is: newlinechar  newlinechar - Post early, post often newlinechar - Post a long series of replies to yourself newlinechar - Post from a verified account newlinechar  newlinechar So that's exactly what they do. Make sure that the first thing anyone sees when they open up a tweet is a HUGE list of comments that do everything they can to try to make Trump look like a fool. Because if they saw people agreeing with him, or simply read his message without being told how they're supposed to be responding to it, people might actually *agree with him*.

The corporate media is complicit in allowing these Bilderberg people to  exert control over corporations and governments and individuals around the world. That's what's ironic. They say 'Democracy Dies in Darkness', when the corporate media that refuses to report on important matters to protect their relationships with these kinds of people is the reason the lights have been turned off.  newlinechar  newlinechar Trump is a piece of shit, but they don't even report on his crimes correctly. They ignore actual crimes he's committing or even praise him for it ([those bombs dropped on Syria were 'beautiful'... war crimes](https://www.google.com/search?q=brian+williams+beautiful+weapons)), and then yell 'RUSSIA' at the top of their lungs to distract. Trump has done HORRIBLE things, things we can PROVE, things that are DEFINITELY illegal, and they ignore them. Instead, they focus on vague Russia 'collusions' and never talk about specific crimes that might have been committed, evidences of any crime, etc.

You people cannot make a single point without bringing it back to some sort of false equivalency about Trump.  ***We*** don't fucking care if she met with Trump or supported him or talked to him or Bernie.  It's irrelevant, her *actions* and established political connections to *evil people* are what is important.  You people are buying into Political theater and virtue signaling at face value instead of being skeptical and questioning the motives of why they are pushing this person out in front of everybody as the anti-establishment choice for a likely 2020 Presidential bid.  Remember how Barack Obama came out of virtually nowhere to clinch the nomination saying almost the exact same things?  Or even Trump?
Just because she's controlled opposition doesn't mean she won't get behind certain agendas just to virtue signal for her crowd.  She may very well know and understand that the war in Syria is a giant mess and something we need to remove ourselves from while supporting other more nefarious goals.  **She also upholds the official narrative that 9/11 was done by Muslims, which is demonstrably false.**  In fact, you can pretty much consider it a universal litmus test that anybody who denies 9/11 truth or truth about JFK is a part of the same group of people that have profited from his death and the ramifications of it.

Not only is it against policy, but it may possibly be a hate crime. Mods have always banned people for whatever they want. That's not a problem. Banning individuals for whatever they want is within the terms. Even for just 1 comment, whether if it is with malice or not. Or a private message... newlinechar  newlinechar But where i think they messed up, is that it is a sub specific ban. That is a lot different than individually banning people.  To have an algorithm set specifically to ban people solely on the fact they are subscribed to t_d, is clearly discrimination. They are discriminating against us without even knowing who we are and without us doing anything other than being subscribed here. And they have code on a computer to manufacture that physical ban and make that distinction.  newlinechar  newlinechar Without even bringing up 'what if we did that to a sub what they call us', what they did i believe is illegal. No where did it say on their page you would be banned for being subscribed to other subs. Because that would look crazy. If they are singling out the actual subscribers of this sub, i think there is a case.
Because they bring votes.

Fair. Duly noted the issue on debt based currency, and ideally I would agree. But it's more complicated than that. You can't simply cut off the parasites who control the debt based currency systems without severe backlash - both on the politician who wants to do so, and the public - so therefore it *has* to be a transitional process. There's multiple angles you have to address. It's not a just one-topic issue. If you straight up say 'yes' then you really put a target in yourself. I, myself, (as I'm sure close to everyone in society is also) am an idealist at heart. But I am aware and recognise that it's very difficult to be an idealist in politics, because the system itself is not built for idealists. At least not altruistic idealists. It's designed to benefit those who know how to exploit it. Therefore anyone who goes against the system itself will have to face up against other bent politicians, mainstream media, corporations etc. Due to that it must be a transitional process. *At the moment* I believe that supporting Tulsi is indeed supporting the lesser of however many evils there are. But it's *significantly* lesser, and far more aspects of her policies and philosophies are more altruistic than they are evil, so I don't particularly feel like saying that is entirely accurate. But doing so would at least pave the way for a compete system repeal/overhaul.   newlinechar But anyway, you still haven't answered the question at hand. Tulsi is CFR. What does that mean? And saying 'the people that hate you' doesn't answer the question. Nor does pointing out that the majority of CFR promote financial crashes and genocides, since *she is part of the minority that opposes those things CFR do.*

Indeed.  I've considered an outcome that might do it though.  I'm still not fully convinced myself, but here it goes... newlinechar  newlinechar We know we have Hillary dead to rights on the e-mail server at the VERY least.  We also know that she (and Bill) are the biggest swamp creatures out there and know all of the inner workings.   newlinechar  newlinechar My idea would be to put Hillary in a situation where's she facing life in prison.  It kills me to say this, but I think offering her immunity for the truth and the WHOLE truth is the best way to drain the swamp. newlinechar  newlinechar I would have her in protective custody for months and months and let her list off every crime she's ever committed and who the co-conspirators were, along with where/how to find the evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure we all agree that 'too big to jail' is a problem, but another problem is the enablers that allow it to happen (Abedin, Mills, etc.).  We need to create a culture in government where unethical actions are punished, no matter who your 'protector' is.  This will dissuade lower level employees from being the henchmen for their masters.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see Hillary locked up more than almost anybody, but I also realize what far-fetched probability that is.  I think she would also be a willing witness and it would be easy to sell the idea as benefiting her. newlinechar  newlinechar We would lose the sight of seeing her behind bars, but her admissions of guilt would be inescapable.  As a result, we would get to lock up all of their aides, CF directors, human traffickers, pedophiles, dirty/illegal donors, all of the undersecretaries, congressional co-conspirators (Wasserman-Schultz, etc.), treasonous media members, and so on..... newlinechar  newlinechar Note, I don't think this scenario is likely at all, but it would be the quickest way to drain the swamp.

That's actually an interesting point. I've never really viewed it in the same frame as child beauty pageants, but in this specific case with Bianca Del Rio I don't think there is any perceived competition that equates to a beauty pageant, so the negative consequences (depression, eating disorders, etc) may not apply in this circumstance. In fact- being an individual doing this non-competitively, this kid could develop a better sense of confidence in the long run newlinechar  newlinechar One example of this was when I did (bad, goofy, satirical) drag myself for a college theatre project. I went to Zeezo's Costume Shop in Downtown Colorado Springs and talked to the sales associate about the topic. She told me that for a costume party once, these muscular military guys went as flapper girls, and while it looked ridiculous, they were a hit with the ladies at the party; may have even gone home with them that night too. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the audience is more fawning over this kid because: newlinechar  newlinechar 1) they are and have been fans of the campiness (read: silly, yet grotesque humor) that comes along with drag newlinechar  newlinechar 2) They perceive it as being individual liberty in a sense, whereas in modern pop culture history, this is probably the first time they have the freedom to do so because why not? newlinechar  newlinechar Though I don't see anything wrong with a parent giving the kid tips on doing drag, *if they want to do it* and as long as it looks like a child appropriate Halloween costume.  That goes without saying that if the kid does it against his will, then that is definitely morally wrong, but I don't believe there is evidence that the kid was forced against his own will to do it.

It's an equilibrium thing.  CO2 being produced faster than plants eat it, especially with how much deforestation is occurring in tropical regions.  The rain forests are still the planet's biggest carbon sink and O2 producers.  But as rain forests are reduced in biomass, their capacity for carbon uptake and oxygen release is diminished. newlinechar  newlinechar Water vapor, however, doesn't rely on uptake by organisms to be converted from gas to liquid or solid.  Water cools and condenses on it's own in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 cannot.  Water vapor may be a more potent greenhouse gas per mole of gas, but it's by no means is it the most detrimental based on the cyclical flow of water into and out of the atmosphere.

His logic is that the Dems demonized Russia. This pissed off Russian Americans. Those Russian Americans then supported Trump. No where does he ever insinuate that there was collusion between Russia and Trump. But that it was simple citizens that could have helped. Also notice that none of his statements were concrete. He used words like 'possibly'. So he isn't even saying that any of this actually happened. Just that it could have.  newlinechar  newlinechar So this doesn't change anything. This doesn't show any signs of collusion between Trump and Russia. There is still 0 evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.

I agree with you 100% when it comes to Putin. Hillary can thank herself for Putin taking over Russia as a dictator. He did it after we toppled Qaddafi who was a Russian ally.

Even so, in the future when the automation industry has shifted to electronic and self driving vehicles, the vehicles won't be so expensive, but some one has to spearhead the push for these new kinds of vehicles. Even now, someone with a bit of wealth could afford one of the vehicles no problem. Not to mention Space X is doing great work, comparable to NASA which is pretty impressive. It cannot go without mentioning Elon Musk is a great inspiration to all scientists, engineers, and what not. He is an idol to many, and this is good, its a push for more innovation. New technologies will make the cost of living go down, relieve of us of tedious chores and give us a better standard of living.

Same. This thread is disappointing. Some guy comes the United States and creates thousands of jobs, reinvigorates the push for solar power which makes it cheaper than it's ever been, makes electric cars faster and cheaper than ever, sends rockets to outerspace at a fraction of the cost of NASA, and people are shitting themselves because he takes advantage of subsidies that any other competent business owner would.

Well I most definitely believe that man affects climate change. Maybe not to the degree that some scientists claim, but emissions are definitely a contributor.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I am against is the fact that we are the only country in the Paris Climate Agreement that have a percentage we have to lower our emissions by each and every year regardless of what all other countries in the agreement do. If we are expected to be a member of this agreement,  it must be fair. I am all for reducing emissions, but the forcefulness of the EPA and their regulations most definitely contributed to the death of several American companies who closed their doors or jumped ship to another country with less regulation. One country who took full advantage of this is China. They stepped up their industrialization with absolutely no regulations to undercut American businesses and dominate the world economy for over 2 decades. And now they want to lecture **US** on climate change???  You can fuck right off. newlinechar  newlinechar The EPA regulations are important, but the rate at which they were implemented helped to destroy the middle class. If the regulations were rolled out on a slower timeline, we could have reduced emissions gradually and ***REMAINED COMPETITIVE!!!***  This is speculation, but I bet if we were look in to past emission regulation laws, I'd imagine we would find that other countries helped lobby to pass them. They knew that American companies would crumble having to spend billions reducing emissions. And with federal tax breaks to do so, splitting the bill  with American tax payers, would help crush our entire industrial economy. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  I want to add my first hand experience with this in case my post is seen: newlinechar  newlinechar My father worked in the paper making industry. A Blue collar member of the working middle class. In the early 90s, before the strict regulations, my father and his co-workers made great money and the company he worked for was very competitive in the market. The workers were given regular raises and with overtime,  they were regularly bringing in over $100k per year after taxes. After government intervention and regulation, sales stagnated significantly. They went from upper 20% profit to under 18%  Wages also stagnated. When he retired just 2 years ago, he was bringing down just under $120k per year before taxes. **That is almost 30 years WITH NO RAISES BEING GIVEN.** No more raises.  The company changed hands about 4 or 5 times over the course of 20 years and eventually they closed the doors. My father was lucky enough that he was ready to retire, but 400 or so other workers were not.  You see, for over 20 years, due mostly to strict EPA regulations and low tariffs,  China could produce, ship, and market to the USA much cheaper than his company could do so **ON AMERICAN SOIL.**  We wonder where the middle class went... look no further than our own government. We killed the middle class while China built their own. We were already ahead of the  game and far and away ahead of them on EPA regulations before they got strict. China doesn't care about the environment. They are pushing this narrative to keep us down. So they can keep shipping their products here cheaper than we can produce them here.  newlinechar  newlinechar As I said before, I believe climate change is real and mankind definitely affects it, but we must consider our economy and the dwindling middle class. Before long, there will be no middle class.  As I am sure you are all aware,  The middle class has always, and continues, to foot the tax bill. The very Rich and very poor pay little to no taxes. Who will pay for our missile defense systems, our military, our education, our fucking healthcare, and our entire way of life when the middle class is finally gone?  We will be run by China and other economic super powers.

And do you know why that is? Because the group building the mosque increased the size of the mosque and increased estimates of how many people will attend its services...   newlinechar The fact of the matter is the mosque was proposed to be built by razing an existing residence, located between two other residences, is directly across the street from 3 residences, with another residential property behind. The proposal called for more than 100 parking spaces and a 4,250' building (much more than is there now) even though the property has some wetlands on it. Previous failed development proposals in recent years in the immediate neighborhood include expanding the pastor's manse owned by Liberty Corner Church, and a new church site for Millington Baptist Church. Having been elected to multiple terms on the township committee and serving as Mayor, Ali Chaudry knows the anti-development history of Liberty Corner. Why he would choose such a controversial location for a mosque, where there were, and are, other more suitable properties nearby is beyond me.  I assume it is because he knew he could get more funding for it through the use of lawsuits and pressure.. newlinechar    newlinechar I find it absolutely absurd that the board has as of a couple days ago decided to settle this and the DOJ's lawsuits against Bernards..
So under the Paris agreement, China is still a developing country. So China is allowed to increase emissions until 2030 and after then they need to work on reducing them.

I've always assumed, and seen nothing to the contrary, that the vast majority of CPS, or even, to go off topic, CIA, FBI rank and file are people who want to do a good job and help others.  What has happened though is corrupt leadership has been inserted (if you work at a company that this has happened to, you know what I mean). newlinechar  newlinechar That said, the virtuous nature makes superficial glances at CPS insufficient.  There are actual predators that are committing crimes.  We should be specific, and have evidence.  Saying it's full of pedophiles risks a backlash and ends the conversation.

It shows resolve of steel and a true moral compass. newlinechar  newlinechar I suggest we emulate him in this respect.

Wells where Wells called for 'liberal fascism' and even 'enlightened naziism' and Goldberg ran with that as the title of his book because the intent behind Well's use of the phrase conflating leftism with liberalism and then moving on to contradictorily call for 'liberal fascism' supported Goldberg's thesis which was that Fascism was a product of the left and that the left as much or more than the right still contained the seeds of fascism all the more dangerous than similar seeds on the right because on the left it is unacknowledged and thus indulged in more freely without opposition... I can take issue with some of Goldberg's specific points and think he was a bit shoddy and often unfairly partisan BUT there's undeniably a lot of truth to his general thesis and we're increasingly seeing it play out around us. newlinechar  newlinechar I'd rather he had chosen a different title because like Hayek I'd like classical liberals to reclaim that word and deny it to those who oppose the fundamental premises of liberty and liberalism.

The legal system doesn't view it this way. A commercial business is viewed as a 'public accommodation', in which case anti-discrimination laws apply.

To be fair, the DNC and RNC have no obligation to choose the candidate party members vote for. They have no legal obligation to run a democratically elected candidate.

The DNC is corrupt, crooked, and unethical, but acted within the law.

Thank you so much for verbalizing this. We often make the mistake of using 'addiction' and 'chemical dependency' interchangeably, when in reality they are *COMPLETELY* different things.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If I break my ankle and start taking opiates for pain, and continue to take them for weeks on end, I will develop a chemical dependency. Breaking a chemical dependency is relatively easy; the patient will have some minor flu like symptoms for a couple days and then will return to normal. Likely without the urge to keep using. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar An addiction is a mental issue regarding the pleasure/reward center of the brain. The substance doesn't really matter, it can be virtually anything; booze, pot, porn, opiates, jogging, working out, showering, etc. When we blame *certain items* for CAUSING addiction, we are doing everyone a disservice, especially addicts. Because, as you said, you now give them an out, and a reason to not confront their mental disorder. Instead of understanding what is happening in their brain, people choose to blame a thing. And, as such, never really learn how to deal with it. 
&gt; I suppose I'd rather live in a world that says 'you MUST serve blacks' than one where 'you MAY deny service to blacks' is the policy. newlinechar  newlinechar Well it's certainly FAR better than the prior rule. But it's still problematic because it's still a violation of individual liberty, freedom of association and an intrusion of government coercion on (a no longer voluntary) private interaction. I think we should have at least *tried* liberty out first to see if there was a problem worth violating liberty to address. Jim Crow *laws* existed for a reason, because many businesses *weren't* being racist (they only care about the color green) and those that were were at a competitive disadvantage so they demanded a 'level playing field' to stay in business. I think we would have arrived at much the same place without the violation of individual liberty. Regardless that didn't happen but at the very least we should go back to the original intention behind the phrase 'public accommodations' as a ***limited*** number of facilities like hotels, restaurants and the like.... because the drafters of the law *recognized* the violation of liberty and sought to limit it to unambiguously public facilities: Discriminating against someone at a business that everyone on the street freely walks in and out of is very different from demanding the presence of a private individual who does wedding photography at YOUR particular wedding... I keep going back to that particular example because it is so ***clearly*** a private transaction between individuals, NOT a 'public accommodation' as defined in the law and what happened to her was ironically a clear violation of *her* civil rights and show that the left is no longer concerned about civil rights generally but only about imposing their convictions on everyone else which is toxic to liberty and the opposite of liberalism.

I agree, he's doing more harm than good with his attention whoring because he knows he'll never have to substantiate his claims. Mueller or the U.S. Department of Justice are not going to drop their charges to extradite just to have him testify with a safe harbor clause. Ridiculous.
Yes, and if you read the entire document, you will see not one piece of concrete evidence, only claim after claim. The claims are in line with what you're saying, but there is no evidence. Arguments, in order to be logical, must be supported by logical (or any) premises.

So you think that the conservatives, who constantly preach about American exceptionalism, who try their best to keep old American values and policies, who literally to this day preach about the reds, ie Russia, doing EXACTLY what you're talking about, are secretly in support of Russia?

No because neither of those companies make the cars in a quantity accessible to the masses, nor do they have plans to do so. The range on those vehicles is also unappealing. They also make many other cars that pollute our air and cause dependence on foreign oil. Lastly Tesla does the vast majority of it's building/manufacturing in the US so that means US jobs. While it does seem unfair that 'rich' people get to use the tax credit, almost 400,000 Americans will be getting the model 3 by the end of next year so that's a lot of middle class citizens receiving a tax break. And you only need to make $51k per year to get the full $7500

Pretty much any data you show is going to be tossed away by the left. I'll provide sources at the bottom, but I prefer to approach this from a thought based argument. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We know that China produces almost double the pollution of the US and Europe.  India and China produce 80+% of the worlds plastic in the Ocean. If the world were truly at risk of catastrophe, Global leaders would be FORCING both countries to reduce their pollution. There would be threats of war and bombing if they were putting everyone else at risk. But we don't see that. We see Global leaders whining about pollution in the US, despite being lower than other countries.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar They want us to outsource labor and manufacturing to China because it reduces pollution in the US. Why would we do that if our production standards are higher (against pollution) and you are no longer having to ship it 6k miles minimum back to our country, nevermind transporting the raw materials there in the first place. If the goal was to reduce emissions, we would produce things locally and pay the premium with reduced imports. Companies don't want that though because it reduces their profitability, especially for mass production. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar On top of that, we run into a lot of consumer vs corporation pollution paradoxes. My vehicle would be impounded if it failed emissions, nothing more than a lawn ornament if I'm not able to get it below the legal limits. Companies that own fleets of vehicles are absolved of these same regulations. If we were trying to solve emissions, why would we care about Uncle Joe's truck and not the vehicles that are driving around 8+ hours everyday? If I were to dump chemicals into a waterway, I would be investigated and immediately sent to jail. The previous administrations EPA polluted the Colorado River TWICE, killing fish and wildlife and received zero repercussions.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar These laws arent about protecting the environment, they're about control. They constantly change their models and forecasting, correcting new data for a their assumptions, not the other way around. That's not science. People also forget that protecting the environment was initially a conservative movement from Hunters and Farmers that wanted to protect wildlife from urbanization. It's since been hijacked to charge people excessive taxes (that don't go back to wildlife protection) and control people that disagree with those in charge. That's why the Paris Climate agreement has stipulations for paying money into an account ($100B/yr) and opening yourself to the regulations of those in charge.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar [Source for global warming skepticism](http://www.climatedepot.com/2015/01/03/the-great-pause-lengthens-again-global-temperature-update-the-pause-is-now-18-years-3-months/) newlinechar

They are long for a reason...but they do a phenominal job at moving it along by having several people outside to take your order and pay so you just grab and go @ the window during times they are busy. I'd say other FF  chains should take note, but I haven't seen any others with the same demand as Chick-fil-a.  At least not around my neck of the woods.
And you arent mad at Chevy or Ford for getting the same subsidies?

Duh, the stats are being underreported, you need to multiply them by the appropriate 'feels' factor given by Thementalrapist to find the 'true' black on white crime rate that hes just sure exists.

&gt; Obama, and I believe almost every President before him, has also given ethics waivers to staff. In fact most of the bad things Trump does have been done before, by both Democrats and Republicans. newlinechar  newlinechar Obama gave out 17 waivers over 8 years. Like you said, this isn't really comparable in scale. Trump's actions are speaking loudly, and his words aren't even saying otherwise: anyone who believed he would drain the swamp has been duped. 
It's true newlinechar  newlinechar Watch Jordan Peterson
I feel the exact same way. And I am a science guy, CERN was like badass science to me. I mostly stay out of the debate.
Lol. I'm not here to defend Clinton. Just pointing out that her cronies used the same argument in the past. Her being let off the hook doesn't really help your parallel either. :/
Respectfully, my father is the hardest working person I know. So fuck off. You try running every aspect of a business all by yourself lol newlinechar  newlinechar $7500 tax credit == you pay $7500 less in taxes. Not a handout, just less that you have to feed into the government's money machine

Why do I see this with every elected president?  Hmm maybe they are all on the same team.  Nah its left versus right - dems vs. republicans Zionist vs Globalist or whatever Palestine.  Seth Rich vs Russia Trump, Fox News vs. CNN blah blah blah  
That was odd. Over half the links I clicked didn't exist.
True, but that doesn't mean we can't start anticipating fuel shortages and preparing for it well before they happen. 
The guy he went back in with was a SSGT at the time, last I saw him he was a Gunny. He was the head instructor for my platoon in early 2013 at Fort Lost in the Woods for Motor Transport school. It was cool having him with us but he also had some underlying issues I believe, as do a lot of guys who saw as much as he saw. He got the Navy Cross for his actions. 
i dont follow, why is trump not included in 'they'

I have said from day 1 that there is a very good probability that the hacks did come out of Russia. But I until I see proof that it was the Russia government then I am not jumping on the crazy train.  newlinechar  newlinechar Russia hackers are a thing. I mean, look at any online game. Most of the people doing the hacks are Russian. At one point, like 99% of all spam email was coming out of Russia, not the Russian government.  newlinechar  newlinechar Remember the PlayStation network hack back in 2011? Remember how it was blamed on Anonymous by almost everyone? Well, it was most likley Russian (non-state) hackers. https://www.wired.com/2011/04/playstation_hack/ newlinechar  newlinechar Target hack was a Russian teen, not Russia as a state: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541744/Pictured-Russian-teen-Target-hacking-attack.html newlinechar  newlinechar There are plenty of hacks that happened and came out of Russia. The tools that the hackers used to get into the DNC were most likely made by the Russian government. But those tools have been around for 10 years and have been leaked into the web.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean really, /pol/ had more influence on the election than 'fake news' on facebook or twitter. Unless you really believe that most people thought that HRC was a lizard person who was in charge of the Freemasons, while covering up the moon landings. That was the kind of 'fake news' I was seeing on social media. Same shit I used to see waiting in line in the grocery store.

I suspect most are not even ugly and just mean people who come here to make themselves feel better ( such as HickGoneWild)
Elected officials are likely in on it. Mafia is alive and well.
I agree with you.  Soros is an underling.   I just don't think Hillary would be of any help whatsoever.   She's vindictive and full of hate, and once she got her immunity should would produce nothing but disinformation.
When your enemies are making mistakes, don't interrupt them.

It's everywhere bro, it's basically the point of this site. People get their pics posted without permission all the time.
It's about taxing carbon emissions and for different countries at different rates. It essentially is global taxation of something that lacks factual basis.  newlinechar  newlinechar CO2 laden energy industries can be 'clean' with existing technology. These types of deals don't care, they exist to tank all carbon emissions and related industries.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar For the millionth time, if any of these crooks actually cared about the world and the environment we would be nearly 100% nuclear powered.

Its pretty typical. Instead of blaming the people that allow guys like Musk to do what people hate so much they're gonna attack Musk for simply being smart.  newlinechar  newlinechar Don't hate the player hate the game.
Go to store to buy tampons. Use store loyalty card or credit card. Track when purchased.  newlinechar Use same card to buy a pregnancy test. Stop buying tampons. newlinechar All this shit is tracked unless you use cash with no 'loyalty' cards. newlinechar  newlinechar Track financial data against reddit user. Reddit user meta-data shows comms with a user who posts in a gay forum. They know he is married and may be talking to a gay man.  newlinechar  newlinechar The list goes on.

Yea. Its pretty insane that you can incite a race war in the conspiracy forum and that's ok, but g-d forbid you call out the chosen people by requoting inconsistent things they've said about race.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean yea it's cool if some random white person gets attacked as a result here, it's just that if a 'rootless cosmopolitan' feels mildly upset it's the end of the world.  newlinechar  newlinechar I got reported for that comment, despite not endorsing any violence/harm or for that matter even denying the Holocaust, but simply pointing out what a few elite Jewish individuals did. Perhaps I'm crazy but this is the conspiracy theory sub, no? 
A very wise investment.   Everyone will reap the benefits...but only some will appreciate it.
I never see any facts, its usually him pointing at a powerpoint slide with arrows and pictures and he has a 'secret source' where he heard about some rat line or whatever. I've watched a bunch of his videos and my BS meter is moderately high on this guy. Also, I'm not a shill, I don't like being bullshitted. And if he's a bullshitter, then he is doing more harm to our cause than good. I have similar feelings with Alex Jones.  newlinechar  newlinechar

How does Europe not value the U.S Dollar and Trade when we are the defacto centralized currency? We are not yet working within decentralized currency so that fact is wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar This agreement is all about having that seat at the table. We are voluntarily walking away just the way UK backed out of the EU under false information and pretenses. In this case, Trump does not believe in climate change and has no interest in participating in this massive global market (we lose money and jobs to overseas) newlinechar  newlinechar And how will other countries suffer if they impose tarrifs on the US? They MAKE money from importing our goods and if we choose not to sell to them, they will purchase from other countries for much cheaper. newlinechar  newlinechar I do not think you understand what is going on here. Please read the wikipedia article it does a very good job of explaining this agreement.  newlinechar  newlinechar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement
There's no doubt they won't be turning a profit in Trump's first term.  I do think it's impressive they've managed to create a previously non-existent market by themselves but until they can ramp up their production facilities to produce millions of cars per year (at least 5 years away, could be more than 10), they won't be profitable.  There's no doubt their market value and the cash influx they're receiving is coming from investors who are 'true-believers' per say in Musk's dream of a sustainable energy world.  I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but they and we should be informed that Tesla is running on hopes &amp; dreams instead of solid data. 
kids see something unusual like elsa getting hurt or spiderman pooping and they are curious. when i caught my kid watching this crap it was clear from the internet history that she's just looked at each video briefly to see what it was and then moved on. that's what they want, more views, it doesn't matter if kids don't watch the whole video. you have to watch your kids constantly if they are on youtube. people have taken advantage of kids' curiosity and created 'clickbait for kids' with these videos.
And green phlegm.
Will the Seth Rich murder ever be closed?  I'm starting to think not...all the players involved are too entrenched.  Who will bring them down if everyone is in on it?  Someone that won't get suicided?
Awesome! Glad we were able to find local deplorables both here and there.  newlinechar 
Yeah. He showed it to two different teachers who told him to keep it in his backpack because it looked like a bomb, and the police were only called after he plugged it in and intentionally set off the alarm during class.

Damn. Good for you. Im thoroughly addicted to sugar and I know it. Hopefully I can keep this in mind next time I'm tempted by some sugary candy or something like that. Even if what you experienced was a placebo, the healthier lifestyle you now live certainly cant be bad for you.
Look, I think we're basically on the same page here. I want them all gone. Not just out of power - jail, whatever, gone. ALL of them. But I'm willing to take what we can get. We need results.

Tear the whole fucking thing down. I don't care what it costs. 
Not saying I don't believe but I don't really trust those sources.  I will look into the matter some more.  Just to be clear, I don't think the earth is flat but have always had those questions.  Thank you for pointing me in the direction for plausible answers.
