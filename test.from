&gt; Nobody is saying otherwise, so what the fuck are you talking about? This is an egregious strawman and discredits everything you say. You are a nasty piece of work. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm talking about you and all your friends are wasting your time discrediting the entire community of people who are 'looking for the truth' by apologizing for hitler, and spending the energy/effort/time in your life on it, for no productive reason. Even if ANY of your holocaust 'revision' theories were true and you could prove it to the whole world, it would have no meaningful impact on the world, change absolutely nothing, and help *no one*. All that you are doing is apologizing for and trying to exonerate a group of people who kidnapped and murdered millions in concentration camps. You are BEING 'a nasty piece of work' while feigning self-righteousness, while accusing me of that, so once again, you are the one doing what you accuse me of doing - you and your friends ARE the shills, because there is no way in hell anyone is actually as stupid as you're pretending to be. Israel would still exist, still do anything it wants, just like *every other nation state and ethnic group with a military or access to guns does*. newlinechar  newlinechar All it does is help 'the shills'. Either you ARE one and your purpose here is to discredit a 'conspiracy' subreddit on a social media giant by connecting it with holocaust denial(you and all of your day, week, and month old alt accounts and the mods you got to stick the holocaust denial post), or you don't realize it because you hide from reality underneath the veil of your own ego/feelings good about yourself through things, but YOU and your friends are the nasty pieces of work, and you're doing no good for the world or for anyone - other than the establishment, because you and your nazi apologist stormfront buddies are certainly helping the establishment discredit and make a joke out of anyone who questions the official social narrative - simply by pointing to you - by the fruits of a tree you will know it - these are your fruits, 'dig deeper' into the reality of the things you spend your energy on and connect yourself to. newlinechar

This is actually where a lot of us come from with our opinions -- the government at its root level uses these disincentives to get things done.

&gt; then you can't claim that the program is successful or popular based on the fact that people signed up. newlinechar  newlinechar You can depending on what people sign up for.  For example, if 50% of the people who signed up were previously uninsured and now have the platinum plan through the exchange thanks to some subsidies, that can be claimed a success.  It isn't just that simple.   newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing to take into consideration is that us Americans are extremely stubborn.  There are so many people saying 'I don't want to deal with this' when they could actually be able to pay less for health insurance than the fee they are otherwise taking on tax day.  So the fact that some stubborn Americans just sucked it up, could be a success. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, that is how *they* see it, not me.

I would feel safer if the police weren't a corporate entity but rather guardians of the land. We still need a consensus on how to deal with crime, only we need to make sure crime is what is being stopped.
It is city cops my friend. I live right near Philly and there is a massive difference between Suburban cops, Philly cops and Trenton (New Jersey) cops. Suburban cops (the ones that I deal with) are nice as hell. Jersey cops are fucking *assholes* they leap on you (figuratively) for anything and are straight up hardasses, but they're really not too bad as long as you're respectful. newlinechar  newlinechar But Philly cops, straight up just evil feeling when you talk to them.  Philly cops are ignorant, racist and rude and there are tons of videos catching them on it calling people the n word and such. Disgusting. I think the city does that to cops, makes them massively impersonal towards the public.
That's because this sub upvotes anything with conspiracy or any of the other buzzwords in the title.
Calm down michael bay
The union cares about their cops and they are trying to make sure they aren't doing anything more than is required of them in hopes that they don't get hurt over something stupid for no reason. e.g. Instead of going out hunting to find people who are pissing on the street corner, or robbing someone in a dark alley somewhere, they're keeping to the crime that is blatant and visible, as opposed to overreaching and potentially harming themselves. newlinechar  newlinechar I can see both sides of why they should or should not handle it this way but they aren't blowing off crime by any standard. In my opinion there's a fine line between professional courtesy and misconduct and personally I'm not familiar enough with the job to draw it. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Good to see the people who don't agree with me also don't understand how the downvote button is supposed to be used. I'm sure there's a correlation there.
'Similarly, in the Middle Ages, and until very recently, people could not perceive the significance of landed property and the slavery consequent upon it, which upheld the entire economic structure of the Middle Ages. And even so, to-day, nobody sees, or wishes to see, that in our time the enslavement of the majority of men is based on the money-taxes, levied upon land and otherwise, which are collected by government from the subjects, — taxes collected by the administration and the army, the very administration and army which subsist upon these taxes. newlinechar  newlinechar It is not surprising that the slaves themselves, under subjection from the most ancient times, are not aware of the nature of their condition, and regard that condition of slavery in which they have always lived as the natural condition of human life, seeing an improvement in mere changes of the form of slavery. newlinechar  newlinechar Nor is it surprising that the slaveholders, sometimes honestly, think that they are emancipating the slave when they loosen one screw when another had been tightened. newlinechar  newlinechar Both the first and the second have become accustomed to their condition; and the slaves, not knowing freedom, seek relief in mere changes in the form of slavery, while the slaveholders, desiring to veil their wrong, endeavor to ascribe special significance to those new forms of slavery which they substitute for the old.' newlinechar  newlinechar [Leo Tolstoy](https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=%22in+our+time+the+enslavement+of+the+majority+of+men%22&amp;sig=iIOELTQTc8H0x-ThUS2FK35p4s8&amp;ei=grmlVN_DDYf0yATlgoGIBw&amp;id=8TdgAAAAMAAJ&amp;ots=pt5uewUsQU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22in%20our%20time%20the%20enslavement%20of%20the%20majority%20of%20men%22&amp;f=false), 1891 newlinechar

Anti science jeopardizes everything.  Unfortunately science itself has been pretty anti science for quite a while.  It's turned into 'corporate science'.  Scientific truth goes to the highest bidder, and the multi-national corporations have *very* deep pockets.  If the truth doesn't side with what the corporacrats want said, then they just shut it down, stop funding it, pull grants from the schools and universities they largely run, use the MSM which they own to badmouth any inconvenient findings, and/or literally kill the messenger. newlinechar  newlinechar tldr:  Real science barely exists on this planet.
* Acquiring people's phone numbers through google searches newlinechar  newlinechar * Calling those people up to 10 different times over the period of a month newlinechar  newlinechar * Engaging them into a conversation about a board member and *only* saying good things about them while simultaneously *only* saying bad things about the other board member newlinechar  newlinechar Like I said, if both board members were hedge-fund managers, but you specifically focus on the fact that member A was (because you know that 'hedge-fund' is a buzzword that means 'bad' in people's minds) while completely ignoring the fact that member B also was.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then you are using words and propaganda to lie to people. You are calling people for the sole purpose of spreading lies. You are betting on the fact that the people you are calling are uninformed and you are using that against them.  newlinechar  newlinechar But of course, the people in charge are not doing any of it. They have hired a company that has made a science out of lying to people by the thousands. And we were literally not allowed to say that we were calling for that board member. We were acting like an objective 3rd party hired to 'fill in the shareholder'. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, maybe this is all legal.

Judge Kurren was coincidentally assigned to each islands case against GMO and the people voting for moratorum and further testing which resulted in lawsuits from the big biotech established here.

Many of the islands which are considered individual counties have been voting for moratorum or semi bans. Then comes along the corrupted judge to rule in favor of big biotech.

Chickens, beehives and goats will officially no longer be tolerated on the properties of urban and suburban farmers, due to the protection of the Right to Farm Act being lifted from small home farmers. Some Michigan farmers believe this new ruling is in place because large producers do not want individuals to provide for themselves or their families; the believed goal is to ensure all are dependent on grocers and mass producers. newlinechar  newlinechar '...Because this ban in Michigan applies to small backyard farmers *and* those on a slightly larger scale who provide co-ops and markets, **the only option left is to purchase from large producers**.'

I appreciate you including the links now.  It definitely promotes a better discussion.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for pulling from pension money, it's not necessarily an unwarranted move.  Here's a former budget director commenting on the issue. newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.kansasbudget.com/2014/11/now-its-official-kansas-budget-is.html newlinechar  newlinechar The biggest culprit of the budget draining is the state pension fund and Medicaid.  From the article... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Think about this: while the state budget is in serious trouble now, expenses will continue to grow next year. At the very least, the state will need to add $76 million for Medicaid costs in FY 2016, and another $52 million to cover commitments to the state retirement program, according to projections by the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department. (Not to mention, the state should also be planning for more students in school, higher costs for road maintenance, and salary increases for state employees.)  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, you have constantly ballooning costs in these programs, but you obviously can't just keep increasing taxes indefinitely, and in an economic crunch like we've been in for several years now it's understandable to want to bring some relief to your citizens.  The politicians who ran vowed to cut spending, and that's what they're aiming to do.  This former budget director even says... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It’s not possible to sugarcoat this. The current set of Kansas services must be dramatically downsized.  newlinechar  newlinechar He's right.  If wages are stagnant (which they are) and aren't increasing to generate more revenue, you can't compound that effect by increasing taxes to cover ballooning costs you don't want to touch.  You've got to address the overhead, and most of the people in that sub you linked seemed to be accepting, fallaciously, as an axiom that cutting spending is unreasonable.

OK... Please just show evidence there were actually gas chambers and you will shut up 95% of people bent on this. Not that I'm with them, but the argument isnt that the holocaust didn't happen that is clearly absurd. The argument is the death counts are inflated and that there may not have actually been gas chambers at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar Death camps would def be worth US entering a war to stop,  however we had concentration camps too for the Japanese so if it was just that we could hardly claim the moral high ground. The whole WWII story hinges on the evil of death camps, so if there were none that does change things a lot. It would make our side the only raw commiters of genocide(Hiroshima), and the Nazis although clearly in the wrong too actually the lesser of two evils.  newlinechar  newlinechar Arguing that tattoos can debunk all this shows you don't understand the argument being made. Again, Im not picking the 'Holocaust denier's' side or anything, I just wanted to make sure people are addressing the actual argument and not a fabricated straw man.

I came from a middle class district, my feelings towards public schools are a bit bias since they actually did do a pretty good job. I went to school with some very wealthy kids and some impoverished kids but in the end we all received the same education. In Florida the property taxes are what go towards the schools, so if instead my parents saved on their property to send their kids to school they would have been able to spend a lot more than some very intelligent yet unfortunate students i knew. 
Again, that's a shame that you'll let the voices of a few overshadow the legitimate complaints of the many. This state senator saying she won't stand silently while the status quo continues to wreck havoc upon her constituency, and while the media specifically focuses on the few instances of violence instead of the many instances of peaceful protest and civil disobedience, is nowhere near what you wrote. Seems like a huge strawman.

First of all, Multiculturalism is pure chaos and evil, when broken down. The reason we have kingdoms is to separate ourselves so that we can have our own culture and not have to worry about others coming and and trying to change ours..We can trade in peace but what all nations and America is at the top ,is that we will not be able to last to long because those who support their Country and its origins will die and kill for it. While Muslims dont really have a country but a religion. so in turn it is a war of religion. and Trust me The Muslim and Jews are going to get a real wake up call here in America and Europe because they keep trying and trying to push their culture and ways on everyone else. While they complain if the Christians are not politically correct.. PLUS SERIOUSLY WHY WOULD YOU TRY AND WANT MORE MUSLIMS LIVING IN A NON-MUSLIM NATION.? OR CHRISTIANS LIVING IN A NON-CHRISTIAN NATION?. Just stay in your designated areas of the earth and we will seriously have no problems...ALL Countries should do as Japan does in this ..No Muslims or Jews allowed.I believe Japan allows just a few thousand or so just because of business purposes but nothing more..if you are a Jew you are not allowed to live in Japan.visit yes , but live NO.. same should have been placed in the Constitution of America..

But they also lose *a lot* of blood that doesn't look like paint and would gush until properly tournequeted. After looking at the pictures I'm astonished that anyone thinks this is real. My uncle was saved by a nurse that was following the truck that hit him. She used her belt and his belt to stop the bleeding and he still lost most of it. Anyone with *any* type of medical experience would know you're not going to stop a femoral artery from bleeding with gauze. There is nothing even remotely real about that scene.

Why is protesting and voting mutually exclusive? And they did vote. This person apparently represents their interests. But voting isn't sufficient. Voting doesn't get special prosecutors appointed when the State considers action against police. We should want a system divorced from relationships with those the State considers prosecuting.

Hell of a lot voting does.

Then, four weeks later, after removing the aggressive Polish dictatorship, he offered peace and withdrawal. newlinechar  newlinechar He waited six months before countering Allied moves in the West, and after defeating France again made a generous peace offer, including withdrawal and independence for Poland and France. The whole Danzig/Corridor crisis was a provocation -- the dictatorship there was encouraged by the UK, US and France, who were looking for an excuse for war to (again) weaken an economic and geopolitical opponent. It really didn't matter who was in control of Germany, just that it had become strong again. newlinechar  newlinechar - (2) Was Hitler justified in defending Germany during wartime? Yes. newlinechar  newlinechar - (3) Was the NSDAP justified in pursing a policy of encouraging the emigration of Jews in Germany, and working with the Zionist groups to achieve this? (All other Jewish groups were declared illegal.) Personally I think Jewish groups in Germany which wanted to assimilate and were unconnected with Bolshevik revolutionary groups should've been able to stay [and retain their citizenship, etc]. But that's just my opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar [Consider that [between 1929 and 1944 the US forcefully expelled 2m Mexicans](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1403814/posts), of which 1.2m were citizens. The NSDAP policy of encouraging a minority ethnic group of 600k could be compared to this -- although the way the Germans went about it was far more humane and reasonable.] newlinechar  newlinechar I'd also note that the persecution of Jewish groups in Germany was greatly exaggerated by the foreign media. Jewish groups IN Germany actually spoke up against this propaganda campaign. We've all seen footage of stars being drawn on shop windows -- well, as with so much of this mythology, we haven't been given the full context: that happened only for one day, as a counter-protest against the Jewish declaration of economic and financial war against Germany in 1933. newlinechar  newlinechar - (3.1) Was Germany justified in putting Jews in concentration camps after the war had started? Considering various Jewish declarations to the effect of a 'holy war on Germany', then yes Germany was perhaps justified in doing this to the extent that the US was justified in doing the same to Japanese. newlinechar  newlinechar - (4) Regarding the murder of Jews, I think you need to observe that the mainstream academic community is divided between intentionalists (Hitler ordered it, it was official, he always planned on it, etc) and functionalists (it just sort-of happened, but not officially). This divide exists precisely because there is no real evidence that it was an official plan or policy -- if there were, then they would all be intentionalists. newlinechar  newlinechar Indeed, evidence exists that supports, at the very least, the functionalist interpretation. [A 1942 document by Hitler orders the postponement of the solution to the Jewish question until after the war,](http://www.fpp.co.uk/Germany/Kempner/) and quotes from 'Table Talk' confirm this was his position. newlinechar  newlinechar - (5) Estimated Jewish losses in the camps? Well, considering I believe there was no policy of extermination, that the alleged methods of gassing were technically impossible [and also body disposal as described in the official narrative], and that the alleged structures used for gassings have been fairly definitively proven *not* to have been gas chambers, I would have to say *much* less than the official estimates of approx 3-4m. It's not really something I've studied, but in the interests of giving you *some* answer, I'll very tentatively guess 300-500k. [But I really don't know.] newlinechar  newlinechar This statistical analysis of the number of Holocaust victims may interest you: newlinechar  newlinechar http://germarrudolf.com/germars-views/204-holocaust-victims-a-statistical-analysis/ newlinechar  newlinechar In general, if you want to understand what most revisionists are approximately arguing, you could look at these books.

None of your terms describe the energy necessary to crush the structure of the building.

America is/was a well defined concept. The US government is doing everything within its power to drag America out of its well defined boundaries. The real America gave the ruling power to the people.

Well, they were able to get rid of Perot by threatening to disrupt his daughter's wedding. So, I guess he was not the toughest guy. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, so, if a bad Perot type guy won, the current President, say Obama could declare a national emergency and attempt to void the election. It would probably work at this point. The people are so dumbed down. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, Bush did not win in 2000 but he still ended up the President. So, yeah. newlinechar  newlinechar I do not view the CIA as a group which runs candidates, but rather a bunch of thugs that pretty much does whatever the president wants, perhaps more for Repubs than Dems. They tried to control policy under JFK and fucked up. This lead to JFK getting pissed off at them, and wanting to get rid of them perhaps. Bush Sr. was head of CIA so there is a tight connection there. 
Fair point, so IF MI6 controlled the car remotely, AND Diana was 'controlled' somehow to not put on her seatbelt AND the scene was controlled, which it wasn't initially(as the presence of the journalists at the crash site and the photos of her injured and dying that were eventually leaked onto the internet prove) then my points could be disregarded. Also Mercedes would have to be in on the killing as they examined the car afterwards to protect themselves from suggestions that the car was defective. I agree that the technology to remotely control the car has been available to MI6 since at least the 80's if not earlier, but now you either have a team of German engineers who need to be involved, or you're looking at the car being somehow switched, also requiring a team of collaborators working under the scrutiny of the Worlds press. Both options don't fit the MI6 modus operandi, killing her somewhere else quietly, without the presence of journalists using the same technology would be far easier.

Good on Italy. They are actually the only ones who ever helped the refugees- They had a program where the italian navy would pick off drowning refugees and bring them to italy.

First, they represent a minuscule percentage of the relevant scientific community. AE911 truth's list also includes many members in irrelevant engineering disciplines. newlinechar  newlinechar But that doesn't matter really, because none of the members of the groups (at least to my knowledge) have published their own academic papers for peer review offering an alternative viewpoint. For example, considering the amount of money an organization like AE911 truth takes in, it is troubling that no attempts to model the building collapses and submit them for proper peer review have been made. newlinechar  newlinechar An independent investigation (at least from a technical perspective) has already occurred through the peer preview process of NIST's findings. If members of the organizations you listed want to investigate, they are welcome to. I know NIST provided almost all of the data it used to come to their conclusions to allow for peer review. The problem is, they haven't published anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now as far as the 911 commission goes, I agree, another, more independent investigation may be warranted. The commission report was, in my opinion, a flawed attempt. Too many people trying to protect their own interest, including those conducting the investigation. I would absolutely support an effort to initiate this. newlinechar  newlinechar But from a technical perspective, the truth movement needs to actually publish their material in the relevant fields and open themselves up to qualified scientific skepticism before I am willing to accept their conclusions.

Their lack of use of sights and not moving from cover to cover (after they initially go behind the van) tells me that they aren't guys that do this often.

There was a terrorism expert on one of the news channels after the September 11th 'attacks' telling the news anchor something along the lines of, 'terrorisms main goal is to spread fear and that everyone should remain calm.'

I'm an atheist and I am very mindful about fellow 'new atheists' like the Sam Harris and late Christopher Hitchens and how I agreed wholeheartedly with many of their views about religion but disagree vehemently with their views on topics like American Foreign Policy.  I got into a debate today at work with a colleague who hinted that she thought that Charlie Hebdo, because they did not satire Israel was more of a part of the propaganda machine than an actual objective satirical publication.  Hence my Google search and this question.
You made the claim dude. The burden of proof is on you. I've seen tons of videos with this chick and she's always stuck to her story. You are lying. If she really did say that, you wouldn't need to 'wade through hours of videos', you would know the key search terms and it would take you 1 minute to cite your claim.

No that's entirely my point about context actually.   See above for the actual context for one of the main Koran verses used to say it compels violence.

Each major institution is based on genetically influenced behaviors, the expression of which is shaped by culture. The human instincts for exchange and reciprocity probably undergird much of economic behavior but obviously the expressions of it, from farmers’ markets to synthetic collateralized debt obligations, are cultural. “The innate mental capacities of humans underlie personal exchange. These genetic features provide the framework for exchange and are the foundation of the structure of human interaction that characterizes societies throughout history,” writes the economist Douglass North, an authority on institutions.

I don't disagree that with millions of Muhammads in this world, they should make some distinction when referencing *the* prophet of Islam. I just wish they would be more specific and less generic with the use of the word 'prophet.' He is not my prophet any more than *my* prophet (I am Mormon, btw) is *their* prophet (and like I said, some Muslims prefer the other title, messenger). newlinechar  newlinechar I think the comparison to Jesus is a little bit off however. Christ, despite its etymology, has become more of a surname than anything else, and helps to distinguish Jesus of Nazareth from the millions of other Jesuses (that looks weird in plural form) out there. The word prophet is easily understood for what it is in English; the word Christ not so much.

You make it sound as if you believe everything you are told by the press and your government, as if conspiracy and cover-ups aren't real things.  newlinechar  newlinechar It shows a lack of understanding of basic history and comes across a bit ignorant.

Sikhism stemmed from Islam and Hinduism. Islam was in India well before the creation of Sikhism.

I always find it amusing to watch TV news after reading about the stories and reading actual journalist investigations. The news covers only 5% of the story. There's never any context. It's just a smear campaign or a hidden agenda to get people to only think about one aspect of the event.  newlinechar  newlinechar TV News: 'Group A attacks group B in place C.' newlinechar  newlinechar Why? **What?** **Where?** **When?** (Who?) newlinechar  newlinechar In grade school we were taught to elaborate and form a complete story. The news doesn't follow this model. They always leave out the most important W's. newlinechar  newlinechar Average viewer, 'Those dirty Muslims attacked a Western nation!' newlinechar  newlinechar And the beautiful part for big media is that they can't really know who or why so they get to report in a legitimate and knee jerk fashion what they do know.

When the muslim react it's punctual and very visible and violent. When the jews react in France it's on the long run, it's all the time and in a much more pernicious way: for example many people who supported a french humorist (Dieudonne) who was accused of antisemitism, by posting pictures on facebook lost their job under the pressure of jewish associations who complain to their employer that they were antisemitic, ultimate accusation and if you are a company you don't want that on your back so you just get rid of the trouble maker. I won't even talk about all the cartoonist that are systematically sued, go to court, etc... by the jewish associations in order to kill them financially. Of course because jews are so many in the justice system, because the justice system is so jews-friendly and so afraid of behind accused of being lenient with so called antisemitic, those cartoonist, or humorist, or journalist have no chance. newlinechar Let me also talk about the very violent actions, assault, battery, beating up  of people who disagree with the jewish agenda by violent associations like the LDJ (Jewish defense league), considered as a terrorist group and forbidden in the US and Israel... but allowed in France and who had its training center (for combat) in the buildings of the french government !!!! newlinechar  newlinechar This perpetual, constant, heavy and extremely violent pressure that jewish associations exert has no comparison.

&gt;In non-relativistic classical mechanics, the use of Euclidean space instead of spacetime is appropriate, as time is treated as universal and constant, being independent of the state of motion of an observer.[disambiguation needed] In relativistic contexts, time cannot be separated from the three dimensions of space, because the observed rate at which time passes for an object depends on the object's velocity relative to the observer and also on the strength of gravitational fields, which can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You're confused.

A good 30% (to be generous) of Muslims believe that extremist actions like honor killings, suicide bombings, and death to non believers are justified.

[False advertising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising) would be making claims about a product and its effects that are erroneous/misleading. In this case, no part of their advertising refers back to HFCS as fructose. This is just another example of regulatory capture. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the fake scientific justification revolves around what HFCS ~~breaks down into when metabolized~~ is composed of: a combination of glucose and fructose. Their reasoning must be that if HFCS breaks down into fructose then it's really nothing more than fructose. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Sucrose metabolizes into Fructose and Glucose, not HFCS. newlinechar  newlinechar The food industry appears to rely on studies which showed sweeter tasting flavors [stimulate appetite](http://news.yale.edu/2013/01/04/study-suggests-effect-fructose-brain-may-promote-overeating). A neat coincidence about HFCS is that it's extremely sweet. It's so sweet (someone else in this thread mentioned this) that they actually add additional chemicals to soda to reduce its perceived sweetness. Given consumer backlash against HFCS, and how much their profits depend on it, you can see why they'd want to tamper with the word itself.
To point: there's not a shred of doubt that there are passages of the Quran that are easily interpreted to promote violence and Jihad, and Mohammad was a general-prophet, but still a wartime leader. These are dangerous qualifications, and Islam is a religion that _certainly_ has its ankles deep in blood. newlinechar  newlinechar But that's not the point of my discussion; to deny the rather Proud History of Violence of Islam is one thing, but to point out the stupidity and ignorance of comics like these. When faced with somebody nearby and an urge to fight, Christians have been all-too-quick to use the 'Convert or Die' mantra to justify their actions, and there are passages in the Bible they used to validate what they did.

I'm not sure that logic fits, really—while in a certain sense it might be true, that'd be the same as saying, if England invaded France tomorrow, that the Frenchies started it by taking over Normandy hundreds of years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar The Seljuk Turks clashed with the Byzantine Empire over sections of Anatolia in the mid-11th century, and had extended to control most of the Turkish Peninsula mostly through the Byzantine's incredible lack of anything approaching a good army—these 'aggressors' were mostly mercenaries with nothing better to do, if that tells you anything about the state of the Byzantine Empire. newlinechar  newlinechar Which, it isn't as if this was the first attack on the Byzantines. Remember, this is a full _four hundred years_ after the conquest of Jerusalem. So what prompted it this time? It's most likely that the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos saw that the people who had been fighting him were severely weakened by internal conflict and saw a chance to return a bite to them. It's not really clear when or how the target of Jerusalem came into it, but some scholars have suggested that the populace of Western Europe wouldn't have raised a Crusade merely to protect the Eastern Orthodox Christians—they needed something to plunder: Jerusalem. newlinechar  newlinechar It's honestly much more honest to call the Crusades the Western Conquest of Jerusalem. While it's your right to call it the continuation of or retaliation to something that happened four centuries earlier, that's certainly not the overarching theme history treats them as...

I would disagree.

Yeah they've used political correctness and cultural Marxism to cultivate a society in which they're immune to criticism...a culture of self censorship in which people feel guilty even looking to how Marxism subverts traditional values because they'll be called an anti Semite. I know youre a regular here, have you seen the interview with Yuri Besmenov about ideological subversion in the US from the 80s? He foreshadows a lot about what's happening currently and referred to our future as 'Marxist Leninist' America. Its a newly acknowledged kind of war, and most people are just now realizing that by changing ones perception and ones conscious mechanism, you never have to fire a single bullet to take over an entire nation. Of course, it's taboo to mention that Marx is a Jewish philosopher (Wikipedia calls him a German philosopher) and its taboo to mention the Jews role in the Bolshevik revolution. It's all those evil Germans and Russians, not the cult like religion that spawned those ideas. When you ask a Jew why theyve been kicked out of over 190 nations throughout history, it's ALWAYS the other guys fault. Not because they've been known historically to subvert societies, exploit 'goyim' and parade around with a superiority complex and narcissism....no, the countries that were getting subverted and manipulated were always just 'anti semites' 
Murder or pedophile joke, either way, you are correct.
Read it again. The data is entered from the hardcopy of the Marines' SF133 only because the electronic data is delayed.

I've encountered this on the Internet a few times about Ukraine this year that people just can't seem understand that living there is not some huge deal and its just about wanting to go over there and to accept and deal with all of the changes in lifestyle.  In the meantime it won't stop people from overextending on their knowledge of an issue.  Its been real obvious to me for a number of years that I don't get respect for the things that I've done.  In my ideal world I'd like to see UFM1 and UFM2 saying 'WOW! You were living in that place that everyone was talking about this last year!  Whats going on over there?'

I thought it was people ignorantly assuming that others talking about it were antisemites. I have asked these questions a few times.

It's better off buried,  cause if i see a decent conversation going on that's been raided by the reddit, white power folks, I'm not reading any further.  Maybe people were just trying to avoid that? No,  i don't believe that, and I'm not trying to give the purposefully ignorant an excuse, but it's possible, so it's got it's place (however small).

Very much so. A big problem with every person receiving higher education is that the value of the degree lessons. In a few years an AA degree could be the equivalent of a high school diploma. Not a great example, but an example, is the situation in the Philippines where the government pays for all education up to your bachelor's degree. As a result, you can't even work at a McDonald's without a bachelor's.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think the country needs to focus more on creating an environment that demands more employment of lower educated persons.

Plus the cost of tuition would drop if there's a lower demand.

That is really cool.
It's healthy to be reminded that anything COULD be a false flag. We need to remember that about everything we read, even if 99.9 percent turn out to be 'genuine'. Historically we have often been pushed into war through lies (WMD, babies in incubators, etc.) and given the high cost of war suspicion is extremely healthy IMO. newlinechar  newlinechar On a broader scale all terrorism is false flag: the acts themselves are insignificant on a national scale (though obviously highly significant to those concerned!). Draw a chart of all the painful ways to die, and there are a thousand illnesses then various accidents, and terrorism is much less than the statistical noise threshold. What makes it this horrible thing is our decision to publicise it.  newlinechar  newlinechar We could also argue that we create it: first by invading other countries, then by giving billions of dollars of free publicity to any disaffected youth who can find a gun. But even if we ignore that, terrorism only exists as a category because we create it. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine if we chose some other cause of death. Say, drowning. Drowning is unexpected and tragic and horrible, just like terrorism. If we whipped everyone up into a frenzy then it would be a kind of false flag: sure, water exists, but the decision to make it this big scary thing is purely our own. We control the bogeyman, we create it, because it suits us to have an enemy. 
Yea they don't do that in the us either... The ID thing sounds like total bullshit. There is NO reason they would have any ID on them. 
&gt; Michelson-Morley demonstrates the earth doesn't move. It's the reason relativity was create in the first place newlinechar  newlinechar My research indicates a contradictory claim.  newlinechar  newlinechar * First, their experiment was intended to prove the existence of aether, which it had failed to do. Repeated tests of this experiment succumbed to the same fate, thus a new theory was developed that omitted any mentioning of aether -- that was relativity. newlinechar  newlinechar * Second, in more modern experiments based on the Michelson Morley design, the earths velocity was used in part of their calculations.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Airy's Failure newlinechar  newlinechar Once again you quote a late 1800s experiment to support your claim. Regardless, i dont see this as proof or evidence of a stationary earth. newlinechar  newlinechar And that link, warn someone before you post a link that causes a download. Thats sketchy and unethical. And try another source that is not from something called 'The Biblical Astronomer.' That will lead into an argument that i would rather not have. So i will disregard this link, and this part of your argument, until you provide another source of material to discredit the parallax and abberation. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The doppler effect is not proof of the Earth moving. That's comical. newlinechar  newlinechar The doppler effect can be observed as the earth rotates around our sun. During the phase where the earth is moving away from a star, the lightwaves coming from that star seem lengthened, causing a red shift. When the earth is in the phase of its revolving around the sun that causes it to move towards another star, that stars lightwaves tend to be shortened, causing it to look bluer. This is pretty good evidence that the sun is, in fact, moving. How do you refute this?

Roundup is nothing you'd want to consume, but it does break down relatively quickly, into byproducts that are relatively non-toxic. It's a problem if it gets into water, but it sticks to soil pretty well. Still, it's no different than any other herbicide- runoff can be an issue, and you probably don't want to eat it. You can say the same thing for all of them, though, and it generally isn't like the herbicide gets soaked into the plant like a sponge. Environmental concerns are there, but again, same for all pesticides, herbicides, and even fertilizers. newlinechar  newlinechar As to the biochemistry of roundup ready plants, there's a biosynthetic pathway that all plants need to have working in order to survive. Compound A gets modified by enzyme A and turned into compound B, which is modified by enzyme B and turned into compound C... and so on until you get the product, compound Z. Roundup works by being the right molecular shape to stick to enzyme B's off switch and not let go. With enzyme B not working, compound C can't be produced, and the whole chain to compound Z is disrupted. newlinechar  newlinechar Roundup resistant plants produce a version of enzyme B that's shaped a bit differently, and that means that the roundup molecule can't stick to the off switch. The pathway keeps going, compound Z gets produced, and the plant is fine. Here's the thing- modified enzyme B isn't that different from normal enzyme B, and as far as we know, it's safe to eat (if you follow the links provided by the guy you replied to, you can see links to studies supporting that statement). newlinechar  newlinechar I will agree with you that heirloom whatevers usually taste better, but that has more to do with selective breeding for stable transport than transgenic tinkering, to my knowledge.
&gt; Secondly, we have a lot of evidence of evolution, and if you want I'd be more than happy to link some of it. newlinechar  newlinechar Fish do not gradually become cats. If you have a mechanism that allows for this, you should be getting paid for it right now. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; This requires the universe to be one giant revolving thing, which it is not. hence the issue here. newlinechar  newlinechar What? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Not really, since there is nothing to point to the earth being stationary. newlinechar  newlinechar The Michelson-Morely experiment and Airy's failure both indicate the Earth is stationary and the heavens are moving. All experiments devised to show that the Earth is moving have **failed to show any movement.** That's called indication that the Earth is stationary. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Hold up. First of all, relativity has been shown to work regardless of earth's movement, so that won't change (and does lend credence to the claim of earth motion). We have already found clear traces of dark matter... newlinechar  newlinechar So cite proof of relativity and proof that dark matter exists, then. Why are they trying to prove the existence of dark matter right now to verify their theories? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I have no idea why a stationary earth would somehow disprove it. newlinechar  newlinechar Disproving relativity brings the ether back in and removes the need for dark matter and dark energy. I don't think you realize how much hinges on and is written around relativity being true without any proof. newlinechar  newlinechar A stationary Earth means absolute motion of the universe. It's a whole new ballgame.

Indeed. ten years ago I left a fundamentalist religion, and have noticed that a high proportion of those who leave immediately become fundamentalist ANTI religion (of any kind). It's like we MUST have a black and white enemy. We cannot abide the idea that our problems might be subtle, or systemic, or that our new leaders might have the same motives as the old ones, or even (gasp) that we ourselves might be at fault ever. Why that is thought crime! We have to keep posting those 'us versus them' Facebook messages.

In a masterful exercise of the art of deflection, the Vatican, Jews and common Freemasons have made ideal scapegoats, for certain groups who had usurped power in the 18th century. newlinechar  newlinechar It began with the promotion of alternatives to Catholicism in medieval Europe to gradually loosen the Vatican's iron grip of theocracy, followed by the proliferation of esotericism and initiatory orders to empower the masses and instill the mechanism necessary to logistically support revolt, then with the targeting of the monarchs of Europe by promoting if not igniting one populace uprising/revolution at a time, continued in advocating the ideals of reason and enlightenment, of course having ulterior motives in doing so. These tactics used, in prior centuries, were more or less admirable, the outcome of which arguably leading to betterment of society, a freer &amp; richer society.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately, over the past century, the power obtained by certain entities has since been used to seed chaos and turmoil globally, pursuant to the next phase of their agenda (plan) using a Hegelian tactic: the eventual abolition of Abrahamic religion (beginning with Islam, followed by Christianity and eventually Judaism), to establish a Supreme World Council to replace the United Nations and to remove the remaining sovereignty of existing nations under the pretense of offering peace and security after an extended period of global conflict, among others.

Such dedication to all of this for so long hints there are people who have occult knowledge more important than pattern recognition and a liking of design.  They use 'magic' to influence people and events.  One of the reasons they can do it easily is because outsiders have been taught to believe these things aren't possible.

Just more bullshit to try to get the US (and Christians) to attack the Muslim world on Israel's behalf. It truly sickens me. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, by the way, my best friend is an ABC journalist 'embedded' in Tel Aviv and tells me that, not only is 'ISIS' a complete fabrication (just like 'Al Qaeda'--which means 'I gotta take a shit' in colloquial Arabic--a 'cute' Zionist joke, haha)...but that ALL of the significant rooftop space in Tel Aviv and many other Israeli cities has been rented out to American broadcast journalists and has been for a few years for when the rockets start flying in from Iran after an Israeli provocation. Just as they are doing in France EVERYTHING is turned into a 'oh, us POOR Israelis/Jews!' as they got far over 3 BILLION in FY2013 from the US, have a world-class FREE healthcare system (paid for by YOU the American taxpayer), and HUGE, no-need-to-pay-back loans. Throw in also the free weapons from the US that they use to commit their war crimes (also paid for by..guess who!...YOU). newlinechar  newlinechar There are SO MANY inconsistencies coming out about the Paris 'Islamic' terror attack that it can only be a Mossad operation...or a joint Mossad/US operation (though this is not likely as Obama HATES the Likud government and that shyster used-furniture salesman Binyamin Nuttyahoo). newlinechar  newlinechar Funny how NONE of these journalists has filmed a Palestinian/Hamas 'rocket'--that's because they are little more than bottle rockets with less explosive power than most large American fireworks.

Conservatism is not isolationism. We weren't isolationists in WWII, not in the civil war, not in the revolutionary war. To the left of obama means that obama blames the US military as chief antagonists for pretty much everything bad that happened in the world post WWII.

And historically speaking, leaders who wait until there are no choices left are left with only bad options. 
Tell me how I'm wrong. Free education would imply that professors are working without getting paid, which you could call slave labor. Free education means that all books are provided by companies for free, which would also be slave labor if the government makes them do that. There is no such thing as free. if you think the government can magically make things for free, then you are fucking stupid. The money to pay professors and textbook companies would come from taxpayer dollars, or just printed by the government, which decreases the value of the dollar. I don't care if that offends you.

&gt;That isn't soft liberalism?  newlinechar  newlinechar That right there just means that anything short of hard, hard, hard right policies are going to be seen as 'soft liberalism' to you.  That isn't the case, either.  
Yeah... when Republicans make killing innocent people part of their platform, that may be relevant. newlinechar  newlinechar So far only the Democrats do that.

Exactly. It is more like 'droor-ah' (not exactly, but closer).
&gt;  There are two major reasons people use drugs 1. To suppress consciousness 2. To expand consciousness. newlinechar  newlinechar So simple. So true.
Richard Nixon made a deal with Saudi Arabia that he would protect them militarily against attacks from other countries if they agreed to sell their petroleum to the rest of the world in US dollars *only*.  This meant that everyone who bought oil from Saudi Arabia (which is most of the entire world) had to always keep a pretty large amount of US dollars in its treasury since that's the only currency Saudi Arabia would accept as payment for their oil/petroleum. newlinechar  newlinechar Everyone who uses oil from Saudi Arabia, therefore (which is, again, most of the entire world), needs to have a large amount of US dollars in its treasury since Saudi Arabia only accepts US dollars for its oil. newlinechar  newlinechar If all the other countries in the world that are currently forced to use U.S. dollars to buy oil suddenly STOPPED using U.S. dollars and started using some other currency (the gold dinar, for example, or the amero), then the U.S. economy would absolutely tank and go belly up because the value of the dollar would absolutely plummet and, since the U.S. has very little national industry, exports very little, and imports almost all its goods and services from the rest of the world, that means that, with a nearly worthless dollar, it would be able to buy almost NONE of the things it currently can.  The U.S. economy would, again, absolutely TANK in a big, big way. newlinechar  newlinechar So this, among many other *really* not good reasons, causes the U.S. military to react VERY violently against any country that even PRETENDS to want to use any other currency to buy oil other than U.S. dollars.
Although it matters little, I find it a bit weird that the alleged victims are not prepubescent children as intimated by the word 'paedophile' used throughout. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems strange to risk life and limb to obtain what amounts to slightly younger than normal prostitutes available at your party. Why not just get 18 year olds and keep it relatively above board? Physically speaking, there's not much difference between a 15 or 17 year old girl and an 18 year old. newlinechar  newlinechar Anything's possible and my money is on it being real, but I feel like the really sinister stuff, you know, the real paedophile orgies, aren't being reported. There's a big difference in the psychological effect of hearing that Prince Andrew was banging a 17 year old – something that most normal men can relate to – and, say, banging an 8 year old. That's the kind of indictment that lasts generations and I'm guessing that's why it's not mentioned.
Why's that?
No I think the rules work, were interested in getting to the truth, not attacking people because of their beliefs, or trying to mislead people with headlines.

I have no doubt the the fundamental commandments were meant with goid intentions. But thats not population control. Those are directions on how to live a coexistent life. It wasnt meant to be used to dictate what you can or cannot do.  newlinechar  newlinechar Universally, being good woukd require one to respect another, which means accepting them for who they are, not killing, no adultry, no stealing, no usury, no trespasses.  newlinechar  newlinechar My point is that if you want to control anybody else, you are inherently taking away their freedom. That is evil. Commandments are often skewed to favor the authorities. 'Control the definition of words, and you control the people who use them.'

That's not quite accurate. That only addresses the cerebral aspects of drugs. Many people use drugs simply to feel good physically.

It will just take time to for the free market to fix the problem is all.  newlinechar  newlinechar And more innovation on top of the two that I mentioned will come.

USS Liberty was an accident of friendly fire. Israel admitted to that and paid restitution... long long time ago - 48 years ago. newlinechar  newlinechar USS liberty was the civilian cargo vessel Simmons Victory converted to carry electromagnetic audio-surveillance devices to spy on Israel during a time of war. newlinechar  newlinechar Next time, don't try to get close to spy on a country which is in the midst of a major war with its enemies. newlinechar  newlinechar Even Egypt which was at war with Israel then thinks so. Read it [here](http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/515763). newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway, the truth is '*Both the Israeli and U.S. governments conducted inquiries and issued reports that concluded the attack was a mistake due to Israeli confusion about the identity of the USS Liberty.* newlinechar  newlinechar *In May 1968, the Israeli government paid US$3,323,500 as full payment to the families of the 34 men killed in the attack. In March 1969, Israel paid a further $3,566,457 in compensation to the men who had been wounded.

/u/dejenerate Are you positive you understand politics as well as you may think?  Unions are huge for liberals and the left.  The right is generally 'right to work'.  Did you not watch events unfold in Wisconsin?  Fox News most definitely does not support Unions - and they've run several reports against teacher's unions in particular (which, honestly, I support because of personal experiences with terrible teachers protected by unions).  If your dad supports Unions, then he must not be the brainwashed conservative mouth piece you think he is.  Perhaps you two should talk about your core political beliefs without identifying the politicial group that generally matches with it. newlinechar  newlinechar Politics as a whole do not really fit into the binary that we Americans like to believe.  For one, there are different parties like the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the Constitutionalists Party, and the Communist Party in the United States as well as many smaller ones. newlinechar  newlinechar For two, even inside of parties there are different factions.  For example, in the Conservative party there are the Religious-Conservatives, Tea Party Conservatives, Fiscal-Conservatives, Neoconservatives, and Social Libertarian Conservatives. newlinechar  newlinechar What you really need to do is find out what about you and your father drives your beliefs.  What are your core moral centers which everything else grows from?  You may find that you might agree with your father on many things, in principal, that you have been arguing about in practice. newlinechar  newlinechar We tend to tie issues like LGBT rights, reproductive rights, economics, jobs, national defense, foreign policy, trade policy, state's rights, individual rights, education, healthcare, civil rights, justice, ect all into either one of the two binaries.  And if 2 or 3 of our most important issues fall into one party, then we tend to tie ourselves up in that party for all of the issues. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps if you two broke all of the individual topics down, you might find that you agree with your father on some issues and not others.  Many of my friends who fall far left on social issues actually fall far right on economics issues.  They side with the Democrats because, at this time in our country, they feel that the social issues are the most important. newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck with your father, keep in mind that he can't be a Fox News mouth peice and be pro-Union at the same time (unless it's the NYPD Unions).

Actually, those CEOs were *elected* by their respective board members, and those companies are only 'in power' because they cater to their clients and provide a service to them, therefore there is a certain level of service expected in order for those companies to have that power and remain in business.

Therefore, as OP's article states, more competition is the answer, not replacing one monopoly with another.
I suggest younger people who are not aware of William F.

&gt; It is your duty, as a juror, to not only judge the 'evidence of the case', but the validity of the law, and whether it should be applied to the case at hand. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Jurors have the right and the responsibility to judge the law. newlinechar  newlinechar This is why the judges don't want anyone to know about it - because they'd be out of the job if the people realized that *they* had the actual legal authority to make judgments about laws - not just the legal cases functioning within 'our' laws, and that it would have power over rulings and outcomes in court cases. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the whole thing - *judges* know about their rights, and their office basically empowers them to make and interpret the law as they go along, in any way they choose, it's a serious office - it's scary for them to think about the public rabble realizing that *they* are the ones with the *actual* rights to do that for themselves(seeing as this was supposed to be 'their' / our society - not one run by officers or nobility members only - but all the people, and the officers were purely supposed to *represent* the opinion of the people, not block it out and ignore it and force it down into the dirt like many people who gain public offices are currently doing). newlinechar  newlinechar Without intelligently informed juries, the judged can basically make the law up as they go, or make the law into whatever they want it to be - which is why they don't want people to know about this particularly. It makes life harder for dictators when they can't dictate without being questioned by their perceived inferiors.

An interesting theory. Here's a data point: This year's flu shot did not update the antibodies for this year's flus. The CDC stated that one out of three of the viruses had been changed, but when I went to see what they were offering, Walgreens actually has the very same formulation as last year. So they're keening and whining about how this year's shot is not a good match, mea culpa, our bad, take some ineffective and dangerous Tamiflu! - but neglecting to mention that they didn't update the vaccine this year for the circulating virii! (Note: does not include the FluMist live virus vaccine they give to the kids - I think that was quadrivalent, with 4 different strains, have not compared them to what's going around - it's not outside the realm of possibility that the flu circulating among adults is actually the B virus from the kids' FluMist, improperly attenuated?).... newlinechar  newlinechar Anecdotally, there is something weird going around all over right now - doctors have told family members it's the flu (but they will never bother to test it to know for sure, so obnoxious), but no one I know with it has had a fever. Feels just like a cold that won't go away. Mild for the younger/middle-aged set but harsh for the older set, and long-lasting, up to 10 days, and it also appears to rebound. People I know are getting over it, then getting the symptoms all over again after a week or two. I'd love to know wtf it is.  newlinechar  newlinechar If anyone has had these symptoms and has had a doc who cared enough to test, would love to know more. (And is it possible that this is just a B virus from the kids' FluMist this year that the adults are catching?)
It is a left wing magazine.  It is a no brainer therefore that its primary purpose is to impose anti-racism on whoever it sees as the enemy of its culturally marxist values.  Obviously as Jews do not proselytize they will really be being given a free pass from the anti-racist values imposing racial abuse that the Trotskyists will not be giving to the more threatening to them Christians and Muslims.   As it ever was in other words.  If you proselytize you will get it too.  Another argument for multi cultural tribalism over melting pot social reconstructionists.

But there are billionaires that want to cover up all the problems that the ferguson protests were all about.  Now you are stuck in a paradox that the protests are good and bad...  I don't doubt that the billionaires are working to drive society in a way that is better for them, but that doesn't automatically mean everything they touch is therefore corrupted.  People with views that of this sort are way more susceptible to being manipulated than people that can objectively think about if something is good or not.

I find your comments useless and not very helpful.  newlinechar  newlinechar You cannot build up a 'library' to fight the flu because by your own admission and from reality, the flu constantly changes, and we need to develop new immunity with every new strain or a better functioning immune system. newlinechar  newlinechar You do not build up a library of defense systems for the flu from vaccination. Maybe from naturally acquired flus but not from the vaccine. newlinechar In fact...once you are vaccinated for chicken pox for example, you will never ever be able to develop natural immunity to chicken pox and will be highly susceptible to shingles as well, and you will need to constantly get the booster shoot when the vaccine's time limit runs out...which it does...but vaccination requires a booster shot and does not bestow NATURAL immunity or immunity for life, which is what you actually build by being exposed the the so called WILD virus. My children both had the whooping cough (transferred to them from a 100% vaccinated kid..a kid who was and still is a family friend...notice how I didn't blame him and want him put in jail or murdered for SPREADING THE DISEASE!) and both of them now have lifetime immunity to pertussis. Every pertussis vaccinated kid will never have immunity to pertussis without the booster...that is if the pertussis vaccine is still working...which it isn't and a quick google search will tell you that the outbreaks of whooping cough come from the vaccinated population. newlinechar  newlinechar They do this type of campaign because they CAN'T hide the statistics and research. So they do their own research and bury what they don't like and after it's spun so nicely it is fed to people like yourself for regurgitation to others. So what is happening is they are getting ahead of the problem and saying that it is 'not as effective' but you should still get it...here we have the cognitive dissonance, which in the weaker minded folks is very effective because they default to the *safe choice* which in their minds is getting the flu shot...default to authority. newlinechar  newlinechar As for the deaths from the flu...that will never stop! Fuck me do you actually think that if enough people get the flu shot that people would stop dying from the flu? That's the most dangerous belief there is. No disease has ever been eliminated by the vaccine. Not polio...not smallpox...not measles, mumps, rubella.  newlinechar  newlinechar And flu shots for the elderly?...that's a culling program is what that is. I knew a healthy 90 year old woman who worked in research in studying immunization...very smart lady and always active and healthy...she never took any of the shots until the last few years when she fell  victim to the flu shot propaganda campaigns that are ramping up higher and higher every year...well after her first flu shot she developed chronic illness that no one could identify, she stopped being active because of it and in less than a year she fucking died!  newlinechar  newlinechar If you have old folks you should do your best to discourage them from taking the flu shot.  newlinechar  newlinechar And watch for it this September, there will be a fresh new propaganda campaign aimed at the new and improved flu shot...which NEVER will be new and improved because VACCINES are not all they are claimed to be. newlinechar  newlinechar  I personally don't find them to be pure evil but I do find the push to take them without any free will or choice involved, to be the evil here. newlinechar  newlinechar And they way you are thinking is exactly how the man wants you to think.  newlinechar  newlinechar Default to authority.  newlinechar  newlinechar Believe in all of the propaganda thrown at you. newlinechar  newlinechar And wallow in the cognitive dissonance. newlinechar  newlinechar Well done. newlinechar  newlinechar

For years it worked fine.  The problem is that you throw some kids in one or two classes where you try to scare them out of sex and then pretty much half of what they'll see online or on TV is about how great sex is. It's not hard to imagine that kids will go have sex then. newlinechar  newlinechar People are fully capable of not having sex; it used to be the norm to wait until marriage.  Humans didn't just change and become less able to be responsible, we as a culture have just dropped the ball.  Assuming that they can't resist their urges and will have it no matter what is a harmful mentality to have.  I'd never tell my kid that it's best not to shoplift, but here's how to get away with it, and that's the same kinda message we give when saying that they shouldn't have sex but here's how to be 'safe' about it.  The best thing to do is to teach them about how sex is a big and important thing that shouldn't be done haphazardly.  If you're not ready to be raising a kid, you shouldn't be having sex.

I used to spend a fair amount of time trying to 'wake people up', much of it online. I called it 'disrupting their reality'.  newlinechar  newlinechar I found that the vast majority of people are too afraid, or have a vested interest in staying asleep. So their response is often to attack you. Perhaps my approach was a little too aggressive, but I did not feel that this was productive, for the most part. newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, when we talk about a lot of the conspiracy theories, I couldn't find a good way to translate knowledge of the 'Truth' into action that would improve the lives of individuals. OK, building 7 didn't fall as a result of planes flying into it or fire, it was blown up. Let's say we accept that a group of Saudi's flew planes into the towers, and that the govt knew in advance and had a chance to stop it, but chose not to. So what? How does knowing this allow me to improve my life? It gets me on the path to understanding that the govt is not my friend, and so perhaps I will make different or more informed choices, but I can't draw a simple and direct line between this knowledge, and a happier/wealthier/improved life. newlinechar  newlinechar So I focus on disrupting my own reality, and working with people who have similar ideas. This is much more productive; we can accomplish much more together and learn from each other through cooperation so much more than a discussion that degenerates into argument, and from argument into personal attack. newlinechar  newlinechar When I choose to focus on waking people up, instead I do it like this: newlinechar  newlinechar I live in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Vehicle insurance is insanely high. For a young man to insure a piece of shit car, they will be paying $3,000 Cdn yearly or higher starting out. When we add up gas, maintenance, parking in downtown Toronto ($200/month to rent a spot in the core), winter tires, and paying for the actual vehicle we find that we rapidly approach a figure close to $10k/year, if we want something halfway decent and reliable to get to work with. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead, my wife and I decided to live in a cheap dump on the transit line, and save that money for a rental property. It took us 5 long years to save some money, and in that time the real estate values in our target neighbourhood literally doubled. We had a very specific dream, though, so we buckled down and saved for another 3 years. In 8 years, we had saved about $100k, the money we would have spent on a car plus a little. We put that as a downpayment on a 500k property, on the subway line, split into 3 units. We live in one, and the renters pay the mortgage plus some of the utilities. As the rent increases, we accelerate our mortgage payments, and we pay maintenance, property tax, and the rest of the utilities which still works out to around the same we would pay for rent, some years less, some years a little more. We have owned that property for 7 years now, and put maybe another $200k into slowly gutting it in tiny chunks and rebuilding it from the inside out, and developing it: upgrading from a rented electric water tank to a gas tankless system, rebuilding the furnace/boiler, upgrading the electrical, adding a room, etc. In that 7 years it has more than doubled in value and is worth more than $1 million Cdn, and the renters have paid close to $200k into it. If we sold it today we would probably walk away with around $750k. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, if we had bought a car all those years ago, our net worth increase today would be exactly: one shitty car. newlinechar  newlinechar My angle here is this: I think that the reliance on the automobile is a root cause of poverty in North America. Everything about the media and advertising says the opposite: if you have a nice car, you are rich and successful, but it's totally a lie. I think that this way of thinking is causing generations of poverty and destroying the environment. I have made specific life choices to live, work and play in a decent city with transit options, and that has given me wealth and options that I do not think I would be likely to find any other way. newlinechar  newlinechar From time to time, this simple story makes a young person start asking questions. I even get the occasional message: 'Wow! I'm fascinated by your idea that simple life choices can make you rich!' newlinechar  newlinechar This approach, I think, shows people a simple and direct path that anybody can take towards building a better future both for themselves, their family, and the planet. It is not a simple and convenient choice; it is a hard choice for many people. But anyone can do it.

Thats very plausible, imo. If it came to such measures, i would presume that TPTB woukd be so incredibly desperate at this point to maintain their status quo.  Itd be like their last resort effort to maintain power and control..  do you have any supporting evidence or anything that we can dissect and analyze? (Im not being snarky, im actuslly interested in this idea and am jist wondering where you are in terms of research for this idea?)

There are two ufo sightings that stand out to me. That is the Chinese airport ufo, and the one that hovered over the dome of rock.

Alcorn had posted a [suicide note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_note) to her [Tumblr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr) blog, writing about societal standards affecting transgender people and expressing hope that her death would create a dialogue about discrimination, abuse and lack of support for transgender people.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Alcorn was raised in a conservative Christian household in [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio). At age 14, she [came out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out) as trans to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo [transition treatment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_therapy), instead sending her to Christian [conversion therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy)   with the intention of convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth.  After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to [social media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media). In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the [Interstate 71](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_71) highway. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Alcorn arranged for her suicide note to be posted online several hours after her death, and it soon attracted international attention across mainstream and social media. [LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights) activists called attention to the incident as evidence of the problems facing transgender teenagers, while vigils were held in her memory in both the United States and United Kingdom. Petitions were formed calling for the establishment of '[Leelah's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leelah%27s_Law)', a ban on conversion therapy in the U.S. Alcorn's parents were blamed for their child's death by LGBT rights activist [Dan Savage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Savage),     and faced [online harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_harassment). They were also criticized for [misgendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia#Misgendering_and_exclusion) Leelah in comments to the media; they defended their actions with their Christian beliefs. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;==== newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/GTazFIx.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Candles_for_Leelah_Alcorn.jpeg) newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^Leelah's ^Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leelah%27s_Law) ^| [^Suicide ^among ^LGBT ^youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_among_LGBT_youth) ^| [^List ^of ^LGBT-related ^suicides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT-related_suicides) ^| [^November ^15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_15)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cns6wzt) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cns6wzt)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

At the risk of sounding super cliché, it felt like being in The Matrix, but knowing you are in The Matrix.

I responded to the article mentioned with a satirical comment, but it wasn't designed to discredit him. The truth is that hacking is extraordinarily complex and there is a significant amount of effort that goes into obfuscating the activity with misleading information and false flags. There is a good chance that John McAffee **does** actually know who did it, but how is it possible to verify this? Same as the U.S., where is the proof NK did it?  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that John McAffee is a very interesting person who, throughout the course of his life and career, has had the opportunity to mingle with a range of personalities that almost no one can compare their own social network to. But this hack was devastating to an entire company, its employees, and the country. Regardless of what the group's motivations were, what they did cost millions in damage and unmeasurable cost to the individuals it affected. How is that supposed to go unchecked? This group assumed the same political clout as an entire foreign nation, but they seem to have only formally represented themselves and don't appear to have stated their motivation. If John knows who did it, in my opinion he should give them up.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who dislikes the churn of garbage Hollywood productions, believes the industry is bloated, and thinks media distribution channels are too tightly controlled. There is an obvious need for a reinvention of how movies are created and distributed, but I don't get how this hack solves that problem.

I guess it depends on how you look at it. Genetically you are a woman until your SRY gene kicks in. Without getting into transgender issues, you could think of it as we are neither really male or female, we just babies until hormones (and other factors) start kicking in to give us traits we associate with men/women. Which is why (at least to person like me who has no kids) all babies look a like when they're newborns.
&gt;But this hack was devastating to an entire company, its employees, and the country. newlinechar  newlinechar How was it 'devastating' to the USA as a country? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;what they did cost millions in damage and unmeasurable cost to the individuals it affected. newlinechar  newlinechar Where is the data proving it actually caused millions in 'damage', and in what forms are the damages, lost prospective future wealth? newlinechar  newlinechar Again, how was the cost to individuals it affected unmeasurable? newlinechar  newlinechar You can measure very well how it affected 'The Interview', and it seems like it just made it infinitely more popular, with the few theaters showing it selling out and everybody else paying to watch it over youtube or google movies or whatever else they distributed it over online. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems like the entire purpose was to see how ready people are to directly watch new release movies in their home instead of in the theaters. newlinechar  newlinechar They research market data on a daily basis, and I bet you they had data to know that enough people have a proper viewing space ( amount of people who have purchased large flat screens and surround sound systems, people do not buy that stuff unless they have a place to set it up, which is probably a multiple person viewing location in their home ). newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This group newlinechar  newlinechar This is the problem, what group? We don't know who it is, or why they did it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;they seem to have only formally represented themselves newlinechar  newlinechar How so? Did they put out an 'official' group name? Just keep in mind how easy it is to blame something on 'anonymous'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There is an obvious need for a reinvention of how movies are created and distributed newlinechar  newlinechar LOL, and we've known what it is for over a decade now. newlinechar  newlinechar Allow us to purchase the movie and download it directly online, in whichever format we prefer, be it high quality .mkv or .mp4 , or lower quality .avi . newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;but I don't get how this hack solves that problem. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I explained, by 'hacking' Sony and forcing them to 'pull' the movies from theaters, they forced people who wanted to watch it on release but have no theater to see it at to see it online. newlinechar  newlinechar This allows Sony to see how many consumers are currently ready to enjoy viewing new release 'theater' movies at their homes instead. newlinechar  newlinechar This saves Sony so much money it's absurd, let's go over the figures. newlinechar  newlinechar They do not have to pay for: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Real film reels of the movie to be shipped to all the theaters playing it, those cost a lot of money. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Movie posters to be displayed at all the theaters playing it, those things don't print themselves and they do not print for cheap either. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Movie theater release scheduling/purchasing. Why do so many good movies not make it to theater while so many bad movies do? Most of those bad movies have far more money to afford getting in to theaters, so 'The Interview' saved on those costs.

Yes? I enjoyed being religious too.  Didn't stop me from leaving the faith.  I never missed a service.  If I miss game, I don't worry about it.  Having been very religious, there is no question in my mind that there is a very distinct difference between my love of entertainment and sports.   newlinechar  newlinechar Lets take a different path.  Have you ever watched wrestling? Not real wrestling, like WWE wrestling.  99% of wrestling fans know and understand its all fake and its a giant production.  The outcomes are all preordained and set up.  Yet they still cheer.  When I was into it, I cheered for my favorites too.  Even though I knew it was already decided before hand.  Sometimes you know things aren't real but you allow yourself to suspend disbelief if for no other reason than you want to be entertained.  There are plenty of people who argue that the NFL/NBA/MLB are all fake and rigged.  Non of them provide enough evidence to prove it.   newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, any disbelief is deliberately suppressed for the opportunity to be entertained and escape from reality for just a bit.  If its proven all fake, I may leave and stop watching.  But if its a couple rigged games, I may very well just say to hell with it and keep watching anyway because its FUN.  newlinechar  newlinechar The difference between religion and entertainment is the true believer.  I can stack a mountain of evidence against christianity and a god.  I once put together a video that was separated in 5 3 hours video's discussing the evidence against it.  Yet not one person I showed this too deconverted.  Entertainment and sports has very few 'true believers' that will deny the facts faced with over whelming evidence.  If there was overwhelming evidence of a conspiracy to fix the entire sport, a majority of sports fans would be pissed and leave.  I know because I am one and know many of them and have experience with hundreds in my life time.  This is not the case with religion.  Because with sports and entertainment, there are very few 'true believers' to carry on a known hoax.

The other part about the book that's quite irritating is that it comes across a little as though he's saying 'so this one time, in Iraq, I shot a guy' as if he might as well be saying 'this one time, at band camp'. newlinechar  newlinechar I can't tell whether that's his style or the navy heavily redacting huge parts of text that related to classified material. newlinechar  newlinechar The emotions felt forced and incongruent with the theme which is pretty much 'AMERICA, FUCK YEAH' for at least half of it. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, it makes no bones about killing another human being being perfectly acceptable as long as the United States deems that person an enemy in line with the Rules of Engagement. newlinechar  newlinechar That is the most unsettling part - that this apparently (although not scholarly) individual will blindly follow, without question, the instructions of political figures. newlinechar  newlinechar I will freely admit that I have NO IDEA of what went on, or is going on in Iraq or of the dangers faced by soldiers - and most of the time they have no choice but to do as instructed...but I found his take on it all fundamentally immature and ignorant. newlinechar  newlinechar My respect for that kind of HELL YEAH LETS BLOW STUFF UP MAN IM PSYCHED kind of US military idiot will never be more than zero.

I assume you are talking about the Gray State film as opposed to Gray State: the Rise. Unfortunately, it has not been completed yet.

It wouldn't be double taxed, the article is misleading.  The *earnings* would now be taxed when used for education but you're getting your basis back without tax.

The problem is the vastly wealthy companies will immediately take advantage of this.  Family owned business and low-wage employees must fight together to stop the increasing centralization of power in these industries.  If we raise corporate taxes proportionate to profit, and regulate the out of control greed on wall street, a huge tax burden will be lifted off family owned businesses.  This, in turn will allow these small businesses to better compete with the big box stores, creating more jobs and more wealth for normal people.  We must fight against the increasing monopolization of business for it will be the bane of humanity.

I promised a review on American Sniper. When I sat down to write it, looking at my notes, with all kinds of Biblical references and cultural divides, I couldn't write it that way. newlinechar  newlinechar It's much, MUCH simpler than that. newlinechar  newlinechar If you hate American Sniper, and what Chris Kyle stood for, the literal Hell he walked through, and returned from, and the message of healing he promoted before his tragic murder by one he was trying to help, then you're not an American. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mean you should be deported (although you should consider self-deporting), but I do mean you don't share the American spirit or values produced by our heritage. You exist here and breathe the same air, but somehow your lungs don't breathe in the freedom, love of God, family and country that Chris Kyle represents. newlinechar  newlinechar You wish he was The Deer Hunter or Rambo or some other dysfunctional anti-hero. But he was just Chris Kyle. A man doing his decidedly unpleasant job, and unapologetic for opposing evil in the sharpest way possible: killing in the crosshairs. If you hate the movie, there's no shame, but I also don't have to listen to you, because you're not American.

Could it be that both sides have both good and bad people on it? If you look at us all as humans on the same side, both sides of the conflict are monsters. This is how we need to perceive these things, free of the nationalistic/religious/racist lines we draw that only exist in our chosen culture. newlinechar  newlinechar With all that said tho, there is a clear advantage between the two sides when it comes to propaganda and suggestion. The US war machine is very adept, and to think movies like this aren't used to their advantage is just silly. The entertainment industry is so beholden to shareholders that it isn't a stretch to think those same venture capitalists also hold stakes in weapons manufacturing and the war machine, so it's not a huge stretch... Film has always been used to 'speak to the masses'. Up until the 80s or so, it was really subversive against the government, as control of the industry was far more fragmented and organizations like United Artists had set a precedent already in the past. Now, however, the control has been consolidated so much into 'Corporate America's' hands that we barely have an industry worth paying attention to anymore... Sorry, i rambled a bit.

&gt;The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit. Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of the master’s free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master.

This is pretty much the opposite of what America stands for.

Well I think we're probably best off with no government and preventing the formation of a new one. That was kind of along the lines of the original intention when founding the USA. I think we did lean a little too hard on statism though from the very beginning. newlinechar  newlinechar People think that a world without government would devolve into a wasteland with bloodshed everywhere. I've traveled though and seen some places where government doesn't really have any power or they at least reserve their power. In these places where people are free to do what they want incomes increase at 10% or more per year. It's only when the US or another interest comes in to set up some type of government that things start to go downhill. newlinechar  newlinechar The best formula is to have just barely enough government to prevent any party from forming a government. That was the magic that the USA was supposed to be. newlinechar  newlinechar I sadly think that the USA is a lost cause. The will of the majority isn't in line with freedom. Even most conservatives believe in some level of state control. My own very conservative father warns me of the danger of views that are too 'anarchist.' Of course anarchy shouldn't be a bad word.

&gt;Crimes and Mercies: The Fate of German Civilians Under Allied Occupation, 1944-1950. By James Bacque newlinechar  newlinechar link to book here: https://archive.org/details/CrimesAndMercies newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Mass Starvation of German Civilians in the West newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The chief architect of the post WWII genocide was the Jewish-American Henry Morgenthau. Morgenthau's plan for the systematic starvation of the German people through the destruction of their industrial capacity (and hence their ability to purchase grain for import) was officially dropped by the Americans. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But in late November of 1944, Pres. Franklin Roosevelt told John Maynard Keynes in secret that the plan would be implemented. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull acknowledged that the Morgenthau Plan 'would mean the deaths of some 20 million Germans by starvation.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'What finally assured the prolonged starvation of Germans was the enforced reduction of industry. By autumn 1945, industrial production was deliberately reduced to around 25-30% of pre-war levels, thus preventing the chance of buying food imports...The Allies slowed oil production to a trickle, closed down factories, kept the labor force imprisoned, confiscated or destroyed factories and machinery... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;'By false accounting, the Allies also refused to credit the value of some German exports to the German account, making it impossible for Germans to earn foreign currency to buy food.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In Berlin in September 1945, an official estimated that half the children aged three and under would not survive the next year. The infant mortality rate in Berlin at that time was nearly 100%. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In Hamburg in 1946, in the British zone of occupation, while thousands of tons of surplus military food stockpiles were left to rot, 100,000 Germans were in the last stages of starvation. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In January of 1946, US Senator Kenneth Wherry stated, 'The American people should know once and for all that as a result of this government's official policy they are being made...accomplices in the crime of mass starvation...Germany is the only nation subjected to a deliberate starvation policy...' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Bacque notes that, 'Red Cross food trains were sent back to Switzerland; all foreign governments were denied permission to send food to German civilians; fertilizer production was sharply reduced...The fishing fleet was kept in port while people starved. British soldiers actually blew up one fishing boat in front of the eyes of astonished Germans.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When the Mennonite Central Committee in Canada and the US attempted to send food to the German people, the Allied military governments 'refused the necessary permits.' newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In Great Britain, even the concept of voluntary aid via food parcels from Britain's civilians was anathema to Whitehall in October, 1945. Such aid to Germans was forbidden. newlinechar  newlinechar [(source)](http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Others/Others-Doc-Jews/+Doc-Jews-Holocaust-TheSixMillion&amp;OtherNumbers/SixMillionJewsVs9MillionGermans.html)

Not sold on the way he is going about funding it though. Increase taxes on college savings accounts, known as “529 plans” is not the way in my opinion. By definition, these accounts are really only used by middle class families. Poorer households don’t have the extra income to save (and even if they have a little, there are much higher priorities like retirement or saving for a home). Very wealthy families might use 529 plans, but it’s far more likely that they have complex trust arrangements set up for their children.  newlinechar  newlinechar The larger point, and more concerning to me, is that when the government threatens to arbitrarily change the rules of 'contracts' like this they greatly undermine people's faith in savings. Why should I be responsible and sacrifice for 17 years, if on year 18 I get a game-changer that renders the whole point of everything I did previously moot?

Yeah.  I figured.  Anonymous internet communication seems to bring out a tendency for us to try to aggrandize ourselves in one way or the other.  It's a phenomenon wherein it is tacitly understood that others (sometimes *many* others) will also be reading the response(s) you make to any one individual.  As a result, whatever you say, you better make sure it makes you look as cool as absolutely possible - even if it's at someone else's expense. newlinechar  newlinechar You tend to, therefore, try to make sure that whatever you say sounds and looks (and makes *you* look) as absolutely cool as possible...so that you can walk off of every reddit/internet conversation feeling like [**yeah...**](http://dattatecblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fuck_yea.jpg). newlinechar  newlinechar It's an indication of the intermediate level of psycho-emotional-spiritual development that we are generally at as a species.

I have thought long and hard about that question. newlinechar  newlinechar I think there are 3 simultaneous reasons why most people don't wake up to this obvious truth. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) They haven't been exposed to the information. People simply don't know that this is the case. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) They worship authority and generally believe anything authority says, aka what the media and mainstream culture tells them. newlinechar  newlinechar 3) They are afraid of the truth, because that would mean they have been wrong all this time, which would make them feel foolish. They mentally block out this truth because they're embedded in their current world-view, and like mark twain says 'It's easier to trick someone than to convince them they've been tricked.' Basically, they're afraid. Afraid of bucking the norms, and afraid of turning their back on their earlier beliefs. Afraid of taking a stand. Afraid of the consequences.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ignorance, authority-worship, desire to fit in, and fear. Those are the reasons.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you see any holes in this theory, let me know.

Yes, quote the Brookings Insitute, they're non-biased.  newlinechar  newlinechar Modern leftist welfare policies create incentives for the most irresponsible sexual behavior as possible. For example them encourage single women to have children outside of marriage by allowing them to turn to the tax payer into the child's father.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you allow single mothers - non-widows, access to welfare, don't you think the diminishes the financial pressure on a woman to find herself a secure relationship before reproducing? If she can just go to the tax payers and ask for money to reduce the consequences of her irresponsible behavior do you think that person is more or less likely to encourage the next generation to be responsible? Why do you think we have so much generational illegitimacy popping up since the welfare laws changed in the 1960s to allow unwed mothers access to welfare money?

Well, im only on the seventh paper so far, and the trend i am seeing is very much like how i *thought* the constitution already was supposed to work. Ill reserve my judgement until i read the 85 most common papers of the antifederalists, so that i can grasp a deeper understanding of their perspective.  newlinechar  newlinechar But so far, what i can say, is that to successfully lead a party such as the one you propose, there would be a massive amount of educating involved for the general people. And if this party were to win, it would essentially be the last party. I havent gone far enough to tell whether it would even be possible to amend the current constitution to allow for such a confederation. It seems more like the constitution itself, from its very core, must be rewritten. But, i got much more to read and to learn.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can also tell you that i am picking up everything these guys are putting down, and like i said, i have to rethink so much now, including rereading the federalist papers and some back-research to try and get the bigger picture.  newlinechar  newlinechar But where i am at right now, an anti-federalist party sounds pretty damn good. (I would probably not want to call a party '*anti-*'anything, to be honest, as it portrays a negstive mentality, and folks pick up on this, and it would turn them away before they actuslly digest its positioning in regards to the political theater... newlinechar  newlinechar So far, im with ya.

Contraception leads to more abortion and your arguments for abortion are more of the same old Eugenics arguments against the 'unfit' (non-whites and disabled) breeding.  I know it sounds like a well-reasoned and logical argument, but it's been said since at least the turn of the 20th century.

They have as much power as we allow them to have. When you have a vulnerable mind then yes, it does grasp you, you allow it to grasp you. Everything is in our heads. When you convince yourself that you are addicted and can find no other means then you subject yourself to it. Without the proper therapy, you can only go so far until you hit a brick wall. With propaganda, like you stated, it reinforces those negative thoughts. It doesn't help that we are taught at such an early age only on dangers and biased 'facts'.

&gt; You think it doesn't because you don't understand the purpose of religion. Hint: It has to do with creating a community that work together for a collective interests. newlinechar  newlinechar it's *not* relevant because it does no good in outing the crimes of the people within that community, all that it *is* relevant for, in any practical way, is discrediting the criticism of that community by linking it to racism because they can point to you and go 'look, he's talking about jews', instead of NOT being able to do that about you because you're only talking about the *actual, specific criminal behavior of specific members of that community*. newlinechar  newlinechar Nations are the exact same thing, duh, it doesn't mean 'look, those Americans are all managing the whole world, or look the Americans are managing Iraq because the US army is in Iraq' ..in reality 99.9% of Americans aren't involved, or the few who are are just looking after *themselves* and are associated with one another by birth and are being used by criminals within that 'community referred to as a nation'. Now, let's try your way of dealing with things: 'look, the Americans are doing X, oh, a crime is happening in the world? Look, Americans are involved' - now every American goes 'No I'm not, you idiot', and everyone else in the world goes 'you are an idiot because you're trying to link this to Americans so you're just anti-american' - now let's try my way: 'criminals who happen to be American/happen to have made their way through the structure of American society are comitting X crime' - now there is no way for me to be discredited because I'm being a moron through connecting the crimes of individuals to their nationality. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think you understand anything, like even the most basic things in the world, I would need to explain them to you. Why don't you go look up *every big name in Hollywood*, now check how many are Catholic, Protestant, or any other religion(buddhist, even) - now what, all those are 'religious gangs plotting to control hollywood'? No, that's an idiotic way of thinking. 'Oh look, there are so many Italians in Hollywood, it's an Italian conspiracy'. 'Oh look at that Catholic, look there are so many Catholic, it's the Catholics committing crimes' ..no, it's individuals who happen to be Catholic committing crimes, and including their race or religion in your condemnation of them does nothing but help the people you are 'condemning' by giving everyone an easy way to *rightly* discredit you(for the reasons I have just explained to you, go reread them, you have no argument here that I can't beat because *you are wrong* in your position). newlinechar  newlinechar You give jewish people way too much credit, and you don't understand how the world works, even though you think you do. If you did understand how the world works, you'd realize you aren't helping anyone by pointing to the religion of people you don't like/whose behavior you don't approve of, instead of just pointing to the behavior of the individuals you have a problem with. By pointing instead to their religion, you only *help them*. You certainly aren't going to do any good by turning the world against jews, because guess how that worked out the last time it happened in a society? It was stupid and wrong, like the argument you are making now is.

My point stands, if you go into a Jewish subreddit and rant against the jews you're gonna get banned even if you didn't really mean it. I think the main point is that if ranting against women feels like the only option that's already part of the problem. He was already generalizing to all women from the actions of a few, maybe he could've ranted about these few people in particular. I don't think anyone would've complained about that so it's not really people being crazy and hypersensitive and flying to the defense of these 4 cheating women. Few people are going to mind him complaining about a few women in particular but generalizing to all is problematic.

Yes, I believe so. There's all kinds of cube imagery on the screens behind him.

it's election time. Dems wanna go in strong since they lost the midterm so badly. they know ppl have longer than six month memory on things like gas prices now a days, and as gas goes down, so does the cost of delievery, profits and employment improve, and a paid working american, is a happy, voting for those that made it possible, party.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar True reality. They need to make it believable the dem canidate will win in the next show.

Only one thing those hippies hate more than dynasty families in politics, and that's some Bush. So Hillary actually now has more than a plausable chance to be the first female prez, and the dems get the street cred of first black and first woman. The republicans get to keep the congress, and 'muck things up', or continue to play the heel. In reality, it's the easist job in the world, cause you just say no to everything and enjoy that sweet congressman's salary and perks. 
I think that the commandments are the only place but I think the Catholic church has a get out of jail card as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar The Catechism of the Catholic Church, Paragraph 2283 states, 'We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives. By ways known to him alone, God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance. The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives.' Paragraph 2282 also points out that, 'Grave psychological disturbances, anguish, or grave fear of hardship, suffering, or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide.' The Catholic Church used to practice that persons committing suicide could not have a Catholic funeral mass and burial. However, the Church has since changed this practice

&gt;Why do you have an issue with less than 3% of the population? newlinechar  newlinechar Because herd immunity is a thing. 3% doesnt seem like a lot, but it is when it allows diseases to spread more easily and effect people who cannot get vaccinated.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why don't you have an issue with Merck, who lied about the efficacy of MMR, thereby scaring people off vaccines, causing more outbreaks, and blocking the government from funding better research because they can't justify replacing a vaccine that they've been told is 95% effective? newlinechar  newlinechar I do have an issue, and I don't understand where you got the idea that I didn't. However, it does not, in any way effect my opinion on vaccinations or the fact that vaccine deniers are opposing an extremely well researched field. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you care so much about saving people and getting people vaccinated, why are you spending time calling less than 3% of the population stupid and more time researching for yourself? Finding out what the issues actually are, how to make them better, so that vaccines are safer and more effective? newlinechar  newlinechar Don't fucking accuse me of not researching. I've been familiar with every single point in every single post. Your completely transparent attempts at attacking my character and assuming my opinions while pretending to take the high road are getting obnoxious. newlinechar  newlinechar People who choose not to get vaccinated are ignorant of the science. Plain and simple. Are there issues that may arise with drug companies or vaccine effectiveness? Of course... and these should be researched and improvements should be made.  newlinechar  newlinechar But the fact remains that the vast majority of data supports vaccinations and there is plenty of data to support the claims that diseases are being spread because of opt-outs.

Exactly. We could accomplish so much by just having a few non-shrill scholars on the history and current state of affairs in the Middle East sit down and map out what's really going on in the Middle East on the msm.

The state of corruption between media, government, and international shadow government is getting really bad. At least I feel like most americans are beginning to realize it.

I think this is the mentality certain Germans may have had about Jews, Gypsys, and others.  Basically they were told the Jews and others were responsible for all of the problems in the world.  Including the loss of WWI and the subsequent economic problems.  Basically, I think the people directly responsible for the genocide considered the Jews to be below human, like insects needing systematic removal.        newlinechar      newlinechar Of course there is a long fat line between the people of the world not caring about what happens in Africa and the systematic brutalization of millions of African people.

The issue is not with the people who don't vaccinate for HPV. It's with those who don't vaccinate for measles, whooping cough, and other potentially fatal diseases that can be almost completely controlled by vaccination. Failure to use those vaccines is stupid at best, and fatal at worst.

Just like the didn't give a shit with all the people they killed/let die on 9/11. Why in the flying name of fuck would they try to 'coerce' him when they have already supposedly proven that they can get away with killing 3k people in the middle of NYC? They are apparently masters at covering up the truth, seeing as only schizophrenic idiots on the internet can ever uncover that truth. And they certainly don't have morals standing in their way at this point. Why not just kill him right away and be done with it? Would never hear any of his bullshit opinions that way, at best you would be able to speculate about all the bullshit he was about to throw at you in his shitty book. newlinechar  newlinechar But then again, I guess logic isn't your strongest point.

And going off the /r/conspiracy response in this thread, he gained credibility among you idiots because he died. If anything, the exact opposite of what you claim occurred.

Why wouldn't they, it's not like it's some crazy conspiracy to think that someone would want to add one of their interests to what basically amounts to a work of art, and in freemasonry one of the meanings of the G in the freemasonry square and compass is literally geometry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_and_Compasses, in refrence to sacred geometry.

Now if I was to have the inclination of an act to fuck up a country and I could get a nuke why would I waste my time and resources to smuggle it into a country?  newlinechar  newlinechar It would most definitely get intercepted before it reached its intended target. And if you think these terrorist cant get a nuke because we have all the bases covered you are mistaken. There are so many places out there that hate USA for all kinds of reasons that would love us tk get fucked. They would help them. newlinechar  newlinechar So back to destabilizing our way of life in USA with a terrorist act.  What I would do is have a ship and travel a few hundred miles out and detonate the nuke underwater in order to cause a tidle wave that would wipe out the west or east coast.  newlinechar  newlinechar Think about how much more effective that would be. I mean in am not the smartest person and my idea might not work. But that's an idea and a plausible one. But we only see small events that are not really disruptions to our long term ways of life or production from an act of terrorism. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead we see how they kill themself in order to accomplish the act. Ie being a martyr.  So we can associate a boogie man with the enemy. Now think if we were just hit with a natural disaster that is man made and saw no way to prevent it. newlinechar  newlinechar The psychological impact would strike into each person across the globe and we wouldn't go to work. We wouldnt function and isnt that what a real terrorist wants? newlinechar  newlinechar These are the types of things in my head.

When it comes to such large numbers,it's only the start: I could see military servicemen with 10,000-100,000 confirmed kills in the not too distant future, what with all the drone warfare that is really still in its infancy, it's inevitable.

I have done a ton of research and here is my adcvice. Unless your child has an auto immune disorder or allergic reaction to the vaccines then you are ok and you should vaccinate your child.

It means more Dr's visits but it's worth it to minimize the risk of high fevers and seizures.

So is it mostly the economy or what? What is at fault here? Because entry level or minimum wage jobs shouldn't even be viewed as 'jobs'. More valuable than the 11 dollars an hour you make there should be what you learn while you're there. Money handling, reasoning and time management, people skills and managing resources are all things that can be learned while stocking shelves or being a cashier at Walmart and can quickly lead you to other higher paying jobs. I'm curious as to what happens at that level that leads to people not advancing. It could be purely economical; maybe there's no where else to go. It could also be personal. Maybe there's no drive to do better.

I'm seriously not joking.  We're going to experience mass layoffs in the next ten years as software and hardware lowers costs and raises efficiencies.  For instance, a huge sector of manufacturing is fast food jobs.  Chilis has already replaced the waiters with tablets.  Next will be food making.  McD's is testing order kiosks.  This means more unemployment and shortfalls on SSI, whatever.  And those increased profits and decreased costs get passed to the rich, not the poor.

'Freedom' can be defined in so many different ways that I'm always waring of any 'freedom' measurement that is reduced to something as basic as a ranking. newlinechar  newlinechar In this particular example, both 'labor freedom' and 'business freedom' are taken into account.

So their plan is working then. Create a system in which people don't actually have the time, because they have to work so long in order to pay the debts they have accrued in order to have a roof over their heads or food to eat. Fuel the xenophobia with subliminal propaganda (let's face it, it's not even subliminal anymore - people are just too blind) and divide everybody, make it seem like they have our best interests at hand. I always dreamed of living to see a post-apocalyptic world after a great revolution toppling the system. I don't know what I would rather have... comfort as a slave in a battle that will outlive me or tribulation as a free man with something to fight for. That is the only way I would go to war, never to kill innocent people across the globe labelled as terrorists for an Oil company or Medical firms profit.

They pay their employees too little to live on, so the employees need government assistance which they turn around and spend the food stamps back at Walmart. So not only are they not paying them enough, they're literally taking taxpayer dollars in 2 ways.
&gt;These are the things that I want this subreddit to focus on.

It is possible for a suicide victim to shoot twice. The first shot may not complete the job - hence the second. However, I have seen no autopsy of Gary Webb so the 'suicided' angle is still a possibility for me. He was no doubt driven out of the profession he loved, but he was a capable man who could have made a living by other means. If he were around now, he would be a well known and respected voice on the subject. So if (and I mean if) he did commit suicide a lesson can be learned for those of us going through tough times - 'This too shall pass'. 
I get that following the money is important, but it's not the whole story. newlinechar  newlinechar Imagine a journal article that is funded by subsidiary of Monsanto, but has great data integrity and methods (and otherwise a well-conducted experiment) and who's paper fails to disprove the null hypothesis (e.g. they *don't* find a negative impact on mice eating Bt corn.) newlinechar  newlinechar So even though the science was conducted correctly, would you dismiss the paper?

I am aware of the other corporations, but you'll find that Northrop Grumman is a Jack of All Trades. These other corporations simply do not have the same influence across the board as NG does. They were partially responsible for putting the first man on the moon, and their influence has only grown since. For instance, they do the most lobbying of congress out of all of the corporations working for the MIC. They also build and run most of the surveillance an reconnaissance systems that people in this sub have been keeping an eye on. It costs 12.78 billion to produce a single Supercarrier which is equipped with two nuclear reactors as an energy source. That is quite a high-tech aircraft delivery system if you ask me, something much more massive than anything I've seen that has come out of any of those other corporations.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In other words: Northrop Grumman has A TON of things going on. We've heard about some black ops through Lockheed, but I have never seen anything like that out of NG. Is it because they simply do not get contracted for those sorts of things? Or is because the contracts they are given are so top secret that information about them never reaches the light of day? Most of the top secret drones that have come out of NG are so otherworldly that they get confused for being alien spacecraft and the like. What AREN'T we seeing here?

&gt; Frankly, I'm still waiting on you providing a single example of someone who is proud of being white who isn't also a racist. I've certainly never encountered one in my time online. I think people care, or they wouldn't bother reading/disagreeing. newlinechar  newlinechar This is a very enlightening debate you are sharing here and I would hate to interrupt, but... your logic is faulty.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a black man. Am I proud of it? Well, it's not of my doing, unlike my website, which I designed very well, of _that_ I'm proud, but... yeah. I don't have to make excuses for being black, I'm not ashamed of the tone of my skin, it is who I am so yes, I'm proud of it, just like I'm proud of my beautiful hair. Yet, I find white women beautiful, and asian men, and Native American people as well. All the 'races', skin tones, and particular features like almond-shaped eyes and big butts and huge, beak-shaped noses and fat lower lips are all beautiful, just as I like German Shepherds and Yorkshire Terriers and Rhodesian Ridgebacks and Old English Bulldogs. There is not one race I prefer, or esteem more highly than the other, not one I like least, and not one I want to totally eradicate, exterminate, and wipe from the map of the planet, not one I think should rule over the others or enforce its values over any other, nor one which should be slave to any other. I see they all have different characteristics, a sort of 'identity' or 'stereotype', which is mostly, obviously, for cultural, not genetic or 'inherent' reasons, but is valuable nontheless and adds to the beauty of differentness and diversity. I think we should all live in peace and harmony, and all I said is true except that I'm European, 'white', with Asian, Frisian, and (just maybe) Jewish ancestors mixed in many generations ago.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just because some idiot racists who know nothing about history or politics regurgitate some bullshit they found somewhere does not make everyone who makes an effort to share the truths he found an anti-semite, racist, Nazi sympathisant or white supremacist simply by contradicting the dominating narrative. I, for example, think that the best way to achieve peace and prosperity for all mankind on this beautiful planet of ours we will be forced to share for quite a few millennia still is by getting rid of all the lies and taboos that were fabricated to keep everyone in place (divided, that is), and if only for the simple reason that then the idiot racists - be they black or white or brown or pink with yellow and green stripes - would have no ground to stand on anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar People should be free to share information about history without being called names. If the information is false, debunk it, so it can go down the sewers of oblivion and background noise. If it is correct, adjust your world view or be stubborn, and carry on. Why make claims that everyone who isn't ashamed of being white or black or brown or pink with blue and magenta stripes is automatically racist?

There was also the Warsaw ghetto they were forbidden to leave and had to work for barely enough for survival (and barely is being generous). newlinechar  newlinechar But the jews sabotaged the military equipment they were supposed to build (go figure), so in the end, they were left to more menial tasks. Also Hitler wanted them outside of Europe, when they didn't leave he started rounding them up, so the genocide was not part of the equation at the beginning at least. newlinechar  newlinechar History is complicated and painting one side as absolutely bad is too simplistic to be useful.

&gt;Zero: That’s the percent of children suffering from attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, a neurologist said in his new book, “ADHD Does Not Exist: The Truth About Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Author Richard Saul said that over the course of his long career, and treatment of patients complaining of problems related to short attention spans and an inability to focus, he’s come to one conclusion: ADHD is only a collection of symptoms, not a disease or disorder in itself. It shouldn’t be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, he said, The New York Post reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The number of ADHD diagnoses has increased in recent years simply because doctors are failing to probe deeply enough and question patients about related health matters — and because ADHD has become an embraced, accepted catch-all diagnosis, he said. And more bluntly: Mr. Saul said parents seek an easy way to get their children to sit down and shut up, and the treatments for ADHD — Adderall and Ritalian — do the trick. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But those drugs are dangerous and addictive stimulants, and they shouldn’t be prescribed so cavalierly, he said. For instance, one in nine children are now labeled as ADHD, and two thirds of them have been put on a stimulant, The New York Post reported. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“ADHD makes a great excuse,” Mr. Saul said, The New York Post reported. “The diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults. It can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, rather than stuck in a boring rut.” newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/6/adhd-fake-disorder-neurologist-turned-author-says/
The camps were originally for political prisoners and such in the beginning. The camps were originally labor camps because hey, you might as well get some cheap labor out of all these people that you removed from the rest of your great society. Jews were also really the last group to be rounded up and made up less than half (somewhere around 40%) of those killed. The exterminations didn't really start to pick up until the last couple of years. newlinechar  newlinechar I think a really decent documentary in this area is 'Nazi Mega Weapons' and I think the chapter in that series would be 'About the SS.' Another good one is 'The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler' which is more good for how things came about and how things were before the war, then I think during the war too. newlinechar  newlinechar **tl;dr**: concentration camps started more as labor camps, extermination was more an end game thing that came later

It is money and control that often prevents a worker from being more efficient, so take those factors away and you have a much more productive and happier society. Of course you cant extort or manipulate people so people cant take advantage from people that way. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with the monetary system specifically is that it brings out the worst kinds of behaviorism from humanity. You are creating an environment where we are all competing against each other, this has immense adverse effects where each transaction that takes place is a struggle / fight. The person that coerces, cheats, steals, manipulates, beats, kills, lies, or wins through any means available better then the other person can comes out as the 'successful' person in society. newlinechar  newlinechar Any person that shows empathy / caring / kindness / help / etc etc is automatically the weaker trait and that person will get extorted, manipulated / abused where as the person that was willing to do anything to win is rewarded despite the other persons misery because he got the upper hand over him. newlinechar  newlinechar Soo in essence, you can never have a just society under a monetary society (any means of exchange really) because so long as you promote all the wrong behaviors and suppress all the good ones, you cannot realistically expect anything else in society but those behaviors you promote. newlinechar  newlinechar You can never see kindness, because those people in capitalism lose every time. Often they end up going homeless, or simply are forced to live in poverty, as opposed to the worst scumbags, the worst psychopaths, the worst abusers, those successful people. they benefit from a system that rewards those behaviors and we elevate them to the top for us all to look up to as role models in capitalism (again, any means of exchange). newlinechar  newlinechar The next step evolution for humanity can only come about when we can all live in Cooperation and collaboration, and not in competition. Competition, fucks with us all, it ruins our environment for all. Under cooperation/collaboration, we are capable of far better technological advances, productivity and coexisting with each other.. It is the best way forward for humanity and the natural ecosystems.

After reading through his history, he says he graduated high school in 2009. He says he learned all of those languages at the Defense Language Institute. At most, he is 24 years old.

They do similar things in places like Hong Kong with the metro card. You fund it with cash so even though you have the convenience of the card it's just as anonymous as cash would be. If you're super paranoid just get a new prepaid card every week and you'll never have a record or transactions long enough for anyone to figure out who you are or what you're doing.

I feel now that assassination was the coup that helped the rise to power for the Bush clan. Many want to paint John K. as a martyred figure that would have led the country to a golden age. Personally doubt it. It was just a gangland-type hit. One group gets ousted, another slips in. 
CIA is very dangerous... even now it is watching us and keeping a record for everyone. Beware the CIA, it has the means, the power, and the motive.

It can crush entire nations or kill millions of people in a trice... beware the CIA!!!!!!!!!!

I have no clue. I'm the last person to jump in on conspiracy theories, but this whole thing just doesn't add up logically to me. From a mathematical standpoint, solving a math problem, in general, involves finding the relevant variables and placing them onto their respective sides, but what happens when you get the sqrt(negative number)? You use imaginary numbers to represent it. Back in the day, imaginary numbers were regarded as fictional because little was known about them(where the name came from), but now we accept them to be real. The unknown 'variable' that i'm referring to in this discussion can be thought of as an imaginary number from back in the day, and until more information is given - the equation doesn't make any sense.

First, those reports too are unconfirmed. What was said is 'they appeared to be celebrating or cheering'.  One of the accused said he was in tears and actually quite distraught.  newlinechar  newlinechar Moreover the act of cheering itself doesn't indicate anything. It's a little crass but being crass isn't illegal.  They could have been saying 'wooo!! shit blowing up! cool!!!' or they could have been saying 'wooo! the western capitalist regime is being toppled!' or they could have being saying 'wooo!  dead innocent people!' or the could have been saying 'wooo! our plan worked!' or they could have been saying 'wooo! they got the bad guys and we are safe!' newlinechar  newlinechar We don't know what their reactions were, nor can we make any inferrences as to why they acted that way. People act all kinds of strange ways following intense events.  newlinechar  newlinechar I remember the day it happened we had some nice talks in class about what happened and what it meant and there was the unfortunate sentiment (usually from some edgy punk rock drop outs) that 'Cool America finally got what they deserved' or 'Glad they finally got a wakeup call'.  And that's from people who have zero political affiliation other than 'smoke weed on third period spare'. It's unfortunate, but it doesn't mean anything. newlinechar  newlinechar So let's assume they were in fact cheering at the deaths of all those innocent people. So what? We live in a free and open society. They weren't inciting a riot or shouting Fire! In a crowded building.  Them cheering, assuming they in fact did so, does not implicate them in anything.

This is exactly the suspicious ridiculous thinking that leads to intolerance.  Jews do well as a people because they value EDUCATION above everything else.  Everything.  For literally thousands of years, jews have been persecuted, thrown out of every country and exterminated in some cases.  And not just the holocaust, there were also the polgroms in russia.  For thousands of years, the world revolved around religions.  You did as you were told and were a good pagan, sun god worshipper, christian, muslim etc.  Your worldview and how you behaved was shaped strictly by your religion.  Since the beginning of judaism, roughly 6000 years ago it has been a commandment and good deed to educate your children to the highest degree possible.  The talmud (oral tradition of judaism) is taught by means of debate.  Parents argued with kids around the dinner table; intelligence was held in the highest regard.  When a culture breeds intelligence for 6000 years you get extremely driven people who are expected to be as erudite as possible.  In most american jewish households, a college degree is the minimum.  Post-graduate is expected.  This is why jews are so successful.  They EDUCATE themselves.  And only in the last few hundred years has that meant wealth.  Jewish doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs shape the world because the put the effort in.  That is your conspiracy, that is your smoke and mirrors.  I am just astonished that people don't see how possible it is to rise up in our society.  No matter who you are.  You can go to community college for two years, transfer to a four year university, get your masters then get your PHD.  Then you will be a leader in the world.  But to sit back and just say there's a conspiracy is ignorant.  Jewish people work very hard to get where they are and I think people are just jealous.  But anyone can be a leader, anyone can get educated.
And when I was 10 I didn't understand Moby Dick.

Yes, he did.  I heard on the radio the way the question was phrased gave him wiggle room.  They only asked about interference from DOJ or some such BS.  But I thought I remembered him saying he had 'never' been influenced.  This is going to be a pretzel of a statement.  But I think Trump has the tapes.  He is falling into the trap.  MAGA!~
I don't know how he can say that. I know Comey is a weasel, but how do you weasel your way out of saying that nobody has tried to stop the investigation? The exact quote is:  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;“I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that we don’t see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it, But I’m talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal.

&gt;You are aware that Russia has a far more aggressive foreign policy than the US? newlinechar  newlinechar I totally disagree with this. Iraq,Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and many more all just recently.  We have been out of control. Russia is in Syria with permission from the UN recognized legitimate government.  They are the only country that is legally allowed to be there under international law. We are in Syria funding and supporting variations of AL Qaeda and ISIS in partnership with beacons of freedom like Saudia Arabia and Qatar and are there illegally.  Contrast  that to how we invaded Iraq, on a lie and illegally under international law once again,  and it was of course calamitous for Iraqis.  We have helped create a complete disaster in the middle east and are going full steam ahead in Syria with the the same policy.  Attempting to overthrow a secular government for one that will inevitably be fundamentalist and massacre other sects and religions that don't conform to their narrow interpretation and likely turn Syria into one more failed state in the region. And why are we doing it? What are our motives? newlinechar  newlinechar We have over 600 military bases around the World and have military personnel in 130 different countries.  Russia has less than 10.  Our military spending is higher than the next 10 countries combined which is insane. We are out of control. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not saying Russia is perfect. They arent. But it is us that is the belligerent military power in the world and it is us that is provoking Russia with NATO surrounding them and missiles pointed at them from their neighbors, not the other way around.  newlinechar  newlinechar I say this because I care about America, not because I am fond of Russia. I don't give a shit about Russia. Our foreign policy has been a disaster and embarrassment all while America continues to be consumed with debt while our taxes are looted to kill others with no tangible benefit to Americans.

&gt; Equal protection applies to all laws and all persons. newlinechar  newlinechar Except it doesn't.  The state discriminates regularly against different classes of people.  A person making $200k/year is ineligible for food stamps.  Violence against police officers is punished more severely than violence against ordinary people.

Admittedly, they basically ignored it all in *Obergefell*, but that was a blatantly political case. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Murder by private citizens is against the law newlinechar  newlinechar Murder is, but not all homicides are murder.  Self defense exists, as do a number of other defenses.  In the case of self defense we place the right of the innocent victim over the right of the perpetrator.  If we accept abortion as a right under the guise of 'privacy' then it must, almost by necessity, outweigh the life interest of the child.  Because abortion *requires* destroying that interest. newlinechar  newlinechar And that is why it is not enough to build up the right of children to live.

Most of the Hollywood photographers are from what I've gathered. After living in LA nothing surprises me. So many girls have their families uproot their entire lives trying to make it as singers/models/actresses there. Often coming from very poor cities. Usually around 16 or 17 and within a year they all have some millionaire producer 'boyfriend' that is their foot in the door in the industry promising them the world while nothing ever materializes except their 'relationship' which only exists maybe once or twice every couple weeks when they are in town as a new piece of side ass. Meanwhile their family all work several jobs to make ends meet while these predators prey on innocent families that have fallen for the broken promises of the succulent riches of their success that never surfaces as they drown themselves in debt as their daughter's dreams slowly fizzle out behind the apron as they smile at the customer they are serving, hoping that one day their 'fake it until you make it' mentality finally shines through, as they get passed from producer to producer 'boyfriends' to simply be used, abused and tossed to the side on to the next.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The entire city is a coked up whore house of shallow broken dreams.

Come to think of it, Schumer never really came up with a convincing evidence that he isn't pedophile.
&gt;Except it doesn't. The state discriminates regularly against different classes of people. A person making $200k/year is ineligible for food stamps. Violence against police officers is punished more severely than violence against ordinary people. newlinechar  newlinechar Those aren't good examples of unequal protection.  newlinechar  newlinechar The food stamp law is applied equally to all people. Those who are eligible for food stamps will no longer be eligible for food stamps if they no longer fit the criteria.  newlinechar  newlinechar The police law also applies equally to all people. Anyone who commits violence against a police officer is subject to the same treatment as anyone else who commits violence against a police officer. The special protection also applies to all police officers, regardless of race, sex, age, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar In both those cases, it is the person's choices and not their immutable characteristics that determine their special designation. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The Supreme Court has developed a whole line of cases dealing with this. newlinechar  newlinechar You're right, the Supreme Court does have a hierarchy of protected classes. Age is under the category of 'rational basis' scrutiny, meaning that in order to discriminate based on age, there must be a 'rational reason related to a legitimate government interest'. There is no rational reason or government interest to apply murder laws any differently based on age. If anything there is a rational and legitimate government interest in the special protection of the child because the government has an interest in producing the next generation of citizens. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Murder is, but not all homicides are murder. Self defense exists, as do a number of other defenses. In the case of self defense we place the right of the innocent victim over the right of the perpetrator. If we accept abortion as a right under the guise of 'privacy' then it must, almost by necessity, outweigh the life interest of the child. Because abortion requires destroying that interest. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with the self-defense analogy, when applied to abortion, is that it removes the blame from the mother for getting pregnant. A better analogy would be inviting someone over to your house and shooting them when they arrive. The guest has a reasonable belief that they are allowed on your property because you made the choice to invite them over. In 99% of cases, the mother made a choice to have unprotected sex, and it is her responsibility to understand the implications of that choice.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And that is why it is not enough to build up the right of children to live. We need to take down the legal argument that abortion is a right. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with that wholeheartedly. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Clarified the police case

The funniest part is when they site California's six week policy as being more expensive for employers. (It's not) In fact, the entire 6 weeks (which I actually think might be able to be extended) is part of the FMLA which the state pays for. So they file with the state, the employer does nothing but have HR reply to a form the state sends and the employee is taken care of. It costs the employer nothing but some time off for that employee, which for small businesses admittedly can be tough, but most small businesses also see those people as family and are happy for them as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So more covfefe from CNN.

Anthopogenic global warming caused climate change then, don't be a fucking pedant. newlinechar  newlinechar Those fake solutions should be all the proof you need.  Those people have known this is real for decades, and so they're going to make sure that the proposed 'solutions' don't actually affect their massive wealth. newlinechar  newlinechar The easiest way to fight climate change is decentralization.  Solar panels.  Local agriculture. The internet. Carbon free transportation systems. All that stuff decentralizes.   newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, the (obviously corporate funded) delay campaigns make the eventual international mandates worse.  If we'd had given a shit and started on the path to carbon neutrality say in the 90's when Kyoto happened, the transition would have been gradual, and wouldn't have required much if any lasting centralization. If we'd started when Obama got elected, like he tricked us into thinking we would, the transition would have been a little sharper, but still spread out over decades.  If we don't start till the 2020's or later, as the oil companies are fighting for, then the mitigation curves get massively steeper if we want to save coastal or equatorial regions.

Ok, first of all, you are offending me right now by being so dense.  newlinechar  newlinechar You are clearly offensive if you constantly provoke defensiveness in people. Offense is the common stimulus for defense.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mean offensive like an insult comic or an edgy teenager. You are actively combating the opinions that people express.  newlinechar  newlinechar At first you were deluding yourself into believing that you were just 'simply talking'. But now you are trying to have a 'productive conversation where both parties views are impacted'. That's not at all the same thing as simply talking. Conversation is just an exchange of ideas, the goal is to exchange new information, not to alter the previously established views of the participants. You aren't talking for the love of talking. You are working to produce change in the mind of another person by attacking their beliefs.  newlinechar  newlinechar You are judging people's opinions to be gross exaggerations, and you are trying to change them by attacking the logic. But you are grossly downplaying this reality. But you lack the self awareness to understand that, are the social awareness to understand the true nature of this sub. That's why you can fuck off.

You should look into the case, he was given life because the judge decided to use unrelated to the case allegation about Ross. Specifically, there are allegations (not a part of the trial) that he was trying to hire hit-men to kill somebody. It was never proven, never even documented in the case, which is absolutely ridiculous it is basically 'illegal' to do that as a judge. newlinechar  newlinechar Another thing is that during the trial, there came out evidence that federal agents were involved in silk road (2 of them went to jail) and have access to all of the used evidence. Not only could they tamper with evidence, the evidence itself was equal to a notepad file with chat-logs. However, non of this was allowed to be disclosed to the jury (meaning, jurors didn't know that the evidence they were presented could have easily been fabricated, but also they had no idea that there were many other parties involved in the situation, such as FBI agents who were at the time under investigation). newlinechar  newlinechar There are other very serious infringements on how this trial was conducted, it should be a complete mistrial, but all of the problems were ignored, because the government wants a scapegoat, hence inane sentence. newlinechar  newlinechar He was punished as if he is a head of a mob, when in reality he was nowhere near that status.

Consider the alternative side of this.  newlinechar  newlinechar /r/conspiracy is gathering enough traction that it warrants inclusion in the battle over information going on right now (several months outside of an election). newlinechar  newlinechar That means that these external groups recognize: newlinechar  newlinechar - that more and more people are turning to forums like this to get a read on current events that fall outside of the MSM. newlinechar - that these new visitors treat these forums with some sense of credibility, meaning they spend time here and return with some frequency (ie: it's becoming a habit/routine for many people who may begin as lurkers and transition to active participants). newlinechar - that forums like this represent a meaningful *threat* to the agendas of these outside groups... So much so that they are willing to spend real world money on astroturf campaigns. newlinechar - that they think that astroturf campaigns are an effective strategy on here. newlinechar  newlinechar This is all good news IMO.  newlinechar  newlinechar /R/conspiracy typically identifies these sorts of external threats with swift responses... Those running the campaigns might be able to brigade posts to upvote their agenda and downvote critical or dangerous information, but most regular readers in here know how to recognize this sort of stuff and either ignore it (or call it out for what it is, as you have).  newlinechar  newlinechar In short, so long as people keep visiting, participating, and thinking critically about this stuff, we can relax and enjoy the fact that **attention from external groups is validation that we aren't completely full of shit.**  newlinechar  newlinechar They fear open, un-scripted discussion of current and historical events.  newlinechar  newlinechar They want us to believe that the only viable source of information is the MSM.  newlinechar  newlinechar They are dinosaurs trying to fight against a massive cultural shift... But the dam is breaking and they only have so many fingers to plug up real conversations. newlinechar  newlinechar They are staging and trying to establish footholds for the next big battle in 2018, but they'll have to pay for every inch and they're unlikely to make much headway with the most stubborn amongst us.  newlinechar  newlinechar In the meanwhile, more and more people are being exposed to these ideas... Even those that may or may not be paid to do so. Everyone's critical of something that bucks the narrative that they've known their whole lives at first... It just takes a bit of time before they recognize that while we may not always be right over here, there is merit in questioning the world around us. 
I will be blunt... Barron does have some body language that seems a bit abnormal, but at the same time he is an 11 yr old kid in the public spotlight. Same with Trump... Trump  has very obviously declined from 'peak Trump' in the 80s and 90s(?)  That Trump would have kicked the DNC so hard they never would have recovered.  Trump is extremely similar to my grandpa (ADD, the whole bit) which had a similar decline around this time, and did end up having dementia. (Trump does seem like he could develop it, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE IT NOW) He is just an older guy, and he gets bored and he doesn't want to wait around and learn to do all the shit the perfect way. He is being a real leader and getting shit done.

Unfortunately this isn't new. This information, even without Comey's testimony, has been publicly available for some time.

Great comment, fam. The DNC assumes that the average American is stupid and needs to be led. For me it was Hillary's 'deplorables' comment. I was flabbergasted that here was a politician demonising voters, rather than persuading voters with ideas and energy. The DNC and Clinton had their heads so far up their own asses they thought they could win using identity politics. Well wakey, wakey motherfuckers this Obama voter voted for Trump like millions of others.

Revolutions are often sporadic and instantaneous. It starts small, others join. It snowballs. For example, I know I personally won't be the one who ignites the fire because I'm not in the thick of all this. Others are. They will, and you can hear whispers of it: 'this has to stop.' And if called, I would fight--not with violence, to be clear. I'm a pacifist. But in some way or another. The circumstances reveal themselves in ways that might summon each of us to act in a way unique to our strengths and abilities. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know what it'll be, how, when, or any of that.

You think this article would have been written if Hilldog was President?  They would have published an opinion piece praising it.  No different than if Anderson Pooper said it.  It was submitted to and approved for publishing by somebody with an agenda, and that agenda is not journalism.  They didn't hire this person and say write whatever you want and we will publish it.  They published it because of what it said, Trump is bad.

I think everyone is aware that there are male feminists, people just sometimes don't specifically pay homage to them when forming a sentence. newlinechar  newlinechar The things I'd like to see equality in has absolutely zero push from feminism as far as I know. These things include: newlinechar  newlinechar Prenups having full weight in the courts (if there is an agreement that no alimony should ever be payed if there ends up being a divorce, the court can not overrule the prenup). Same rules should apply to common law. newlinechar  newlinechar I would also like to see the primary caregivers in divorce cases be a 50/50 split. Currently the mother gets primary care if she wants to, unless she is severely unfit. newlinechar  newlinechar Lastly I'd like to see child support payed by the non-primary caregiver abolished. If the primary caregiver is unable to support the child on their own, then the government should provide support (through school supplies, food stamps, etc.). It's bad enough to be unable to raise your child, you should not also be forced to give monthly payments for another person to. This would also get rid of cases where the person would want primary care of the child in order to receive additional income per month, which not all would be spent on the child. newlinechar  newlinechar These changes would tremendously help men who are seeking a marriage and children.

I distinctly remember that occurring but at the time (and still now) people get confused on the multiple leaks. newlinechar  newlinechar Hillary's emails all came through FOIA request.  Can't argue those are fake because she handled those over herself.  Podesta's emails have DKIP verification (not all, but most).  The DNC email you could argue that -- but theres been enough confirmation (Thanks Donna!) thats those can only be considered real too. newlinechar  newlinechar And its still so unbelievable that Hillary can still speak in a room and equate wikileaks = Russia = fake emails.  She's intentionally misconstruing the situation to paint a BS narrative for a low information audience. 
on top of that, the illegal acts done by the DEA/secret service weren't allowed to be presented in trial by the defense, meaning the agents who manipulated and stole from the site/investigation wasn't allowed to be brought up, but their testimony of him contract killing was A OK newlinechar  newlinechar the jury just heard ross orchestrated multiple hits while none were ever proven in court. newlinechar  newlinechar I donated a couple hundred bucks to his defense for this appeal, but I guess you can't win when it's a kangaroo court.

I'd just like to know if there is all this evidence of Russian collusion/hacking, why has none of it been made public or been disclosed aside from anonymous unverifiable sources? Assuming, (from what I've read) that he &amp; his team have been under surveillance since the near end of the Obama administration. If indeed the 'piss dossier' was used in order to obtain an illegal FISA warrant, he would've been under heavy surveillance, all communications tapped, and likely Trump tower. The MSM really pushed back hard against him when he alleged that he was spied on by the Obama administration. Surely if everything happened like the media is saying, there's no way they wouldn't have intercepted some evidence to back up the allegations and again, why has none of the alleged evidence been released/acknowledged?

There are a lot of ex-liberals here. I don't subscribe to liberalism anymore because the behavior and attitude of the left has turned me away from them permanently. Socialism is a dead end, as we've seen in Venezuela and so many other places. The Democrats stand only for globalism, which is destroying the American middle class. They are the party of the elites and the celebrities and the media who tell you what to think. The left is incredibly intolerant and hypocritical. Identity politics has gone off the deep end. It used to be about being fair to people regardless of their race/sexual orientation/gender/etc. and now has turned into full-on segregation and outright attacking you for being white, male, Christian, Republican, any identity that's politically incorrect. I'm a person of color myself (Asian American) and the way the liberals have thrown us under the bus, particularly in regard to 'affirmative action' policies which penalize Asians most of all, have gone too far. You cannot combat racism with more racism, segregation, and prejudice. They prejudge people before giving them a chance. I didn't expect that the left wing would be so closed-minded and the right-wing, or whatever you want to call T_D, to be so welcoming. newlinechar  newlinechar All of leftist politics is now a big circlejerk about how much they hate Trump. It's now fashionable to go around bashing Trump like that makes you such a special and unique individual. I don't particularly care about left/right wing politics. I just want solutions to America's problems. I don't care where they come from. I thought Bernie had some good things to say about how the oligarchy and the elites are screwing over the American middle class with globalist schemes like TPP, but then he sold us out to the epitome of everything we were fighting against. I'm not a Republican, but Trump has a lot of important things to say, if only people would listen. What IS globalism, anyway? Why is it bad? Why have I never heard a president speak about it before him? Things like that.
What in the world is that thing? Is that a photoshop or is it actually an experimental aircraft?

But we have decided to do this 100% the legitimate way. We have waited and worked for over two years, I've been frigging celibate for TWO YEARS, to make sure she gets here legitimately and legally.

Not quite the same. The man said that he has served and hired people of all backgrounds, including members of the LGBT community, so he isn't discriminating against people for how they are, per se. His discrimination is more of an internal conflict of *actively participating* in an activity that goes against his faith. This means that we now have two protected classes that must be considered: both Christians and LGBT people, because forcing people to go against their core beliefs is dangerous water and entirely antithetical to the classical liberal principles that our country was founded upon.   newlinechar    newlinechar Now, entirely denying all services and shuttering your doors to a person simply for their background, be it race, religion, or sexual orientation, is bad discrimination, and should be illegal. However, saying that you won't make a person a wedding cake for their gay wedding, but you're more than happy to offer anything else that you have available, should be absolutely acceptable. Also consider the fact that the person that loses by discriminating is the business themselves, because they lose business of an entire class of people.   newlinechar

The only problem I have is when Richie asked him, 'well why doesn't Wikileaks just drop the metadata of the e-mails?' It's a valid point. George quickly says oh well I talked to the guy who runs the twitter then quickly says he is part of the sneaker network, then quickly shifts to talking about talking with the lead investigator of seth rich's murder saying there's an FBI bullet involved. It's hard to say. That question always, always, bugs me. The e-mails can be dropped without compromising the investigation. But then again I have no idea of the type of world these people live in.

The comment chains are bots, they just change up what they say, manually type up a new chain sometimes, and go back every now and then and manually respond to people that waste time responding to their tweets so it looks like they're actually humans. newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, though, the best way to mess with the twitter algorithm (as told to them, most likely, but the admins at twitter) is: newlinechar  newlinechar - Post early, post often newlinechar - Post a long series of replies to yourself newlinechar - Post from a verified account newlinechar  newlinechar So that's exactly what they do. Make sure that the first thing anyone sees when they open up a tweet is a HUGE list of comments that do everything they can to try to make Trump look like a fool.

Negros are closer related to primates than Aryans. Ancient Egyptians where Aryans but for some reason Negroids claim them as their history. The fertile crescent was Aryan before the Arabs overran them. King tut and Cleopatra where European. The holy lands and Northern Africa turned to shit when the Negroids over ran them. Whites are the most diverse race on the planet contrary to Jewish propaganda. Jews claim Israel is their homeland but forced the arabs from there, only after the arabs forced whites from there. Behind every Communist/Leftist ideology is a Jewish origin. Stalin, Lenin, and Marx were Jews who had Jewish cabinets. The same groups of people responsible for 30+ million Russians, Poles, Ukrainians, and Germans murdered before, during, and after WW2. Jews own the porn industry and are the ones forcing homosexuality, trannies, and race mixing so they can destroy whites, only after they suck western countries into war with arabs and send immigrants to their borders.

That's a cute kid. Playing Devil's Advocate here...but what if there was some issue at birth and they decided to raise the child as a female.

That applies to defense contractors more than anything in America. These companies have spread throughout the country and now have leverage over nearly every legislator.

That's true, and that's the case for most large businesses, but it's not the case for all. Some people are driven by their sense of morality above profits, I would hope most would be, I don't see any situation in which your morality could tell you discriminating against gay people is the moral thing to do and be justified in it. I'm not arguing for or against it being illegal, but that it's just an inevitablility, and that mocking gay people as being the same as incest is only going to hurt your cause by making you seem like a bigot who wants to discriminate, you have a fair argument about freedom of association. Make that argument. Don't be a dick.

What do you mean I've watched hours of him speaking, sometimes he's on point other times he's a bumbling idiot. It really depends on the situation. Even Einstein was a person fluffed up by the media. Nobody is perfect. Also when they did the live landing of the Space X rocket on a barge. The video feed cut out right as it was about to land, then cut back in perfectly landed. That's just odd to me. Although Space technology has had a long history of faking it until they make it. NASA has been very successful and also failed a lot. I believe large companies 'insulate' the public from failures because the public normally gets discouraged super quickly. Since the first test their auto-landing rocket has landed time and time again. That first landing , imo, looked pretty fishy though. The other ones seem a lot more legit. I just think they should never publicly tell people about tests until after they are already successful.

The line of thinking was they had a selection of data they were paying attention to that was through her campaign manager/data manager/resident creep Mook, and they didn't trust anyone else's info.  Why should they, when they thought the midwest was safe blue like it had been for Obama?  DNC was working with a different set of data which disagreed with them, and honestly, I don't think that data ever REACHED Hillary, given how her inner circle apparently rebuffed any outside information that didn't come directly to them to pass on to Hillary.

Same here, about that sick sort of feeling in the pit of my stomach and my brain having trouble processing what I am witnessing.

He's making the correct choice by keeping SpaceX private and funding it with venture capital. The space flight industry is a very risky business, and that would cause stock prices to fluctuate wildly over any issue, which would harm the company bigly. Additionally, if it went public, they would have to seek the shareholders approval for all sorts of things which they don't want to give up ownership of. As much as I want a SpaceX IPO, it's best for the company to stay private. And, if you actually pay attention to his work schedule, he bounces constantly around his different jobs.

Paying money to the eu in the long run so that they can discern which countries need it and then give them part of it while keeping most for themselves. Over 100 billion dollars with more likely to have to be paid in the future. It's a scam that allows the EU to be able to pass regulatory laws on American companies but not on other countries companies if they don't want to. Anyone who doesn't see the bs in this deal is a real fucking idiot. 
No. They care only about whoever gives them shit for free. If the Dems cut them off, they'd just join ISIS and invade Germany.
He tried to get rid of fundamental Christian influence for obvious reasons (can't have an uber race committing genocide when people believe in turning the other cheek). All in all, I think Hitler himself had a tendency towards the nordic mythology, but how far that overwrote his Christian upbringing, I don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar As for atheists, they actively prosecuted the 'godless communists' and had all atheist parties banned in 1933. In the same year, he held a speech about 'stamping out the godless movement' but on the other hand, the Reichskonkordat from 1933 prohibited any Christian officials to hold a seat in any political position or party. newlinechar  newlinechar How much the fact mattered that the majority of atheist groups were also liberal/left leaning and associating themselves with marxism and its 'freethought movement' I do not know, but I don't think it was entirely irrelevant since shortly after, secular schools were also banned due to their 'irreligious tendencies'.  newlinechar  newlinechar By 1939, they also disbanded or converted inherently Catholic facilities. newlinechar  newlinechar TLDR it was a clusterfuck and nobody really knows.

Does that make their property not theirs anymore?  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll break it down for you: if this farmer didn't sell to a person because of discrimination, the customer would go somewhere else and that farmer would lose their business. The discriminated customer will go somewhere else and get the product, but on the way there they will be telling everybody that the previous farmer is discriminating against people for X, Y, and Z. Other people (who are not in the discriminated groups) who believe that is wrong will stop going there and will also tell other people not to go there. In a short period of time, the discriminatory farmer will lose a lot of business and will either start selling to the discriminated groups again, or he'll go out of business.  newlinechar  newlinechar Wanna know how I know this works? The Lunch Counter protests in the South during the 1960's did this exact thing and it made some of the most racist people integrate their business because they were losing to much money.

Especially when you take into consideration, unless by force, it will take decades for the majority of people to afford to buy these cars.

Indeed.  I've considered an outcome that might do it though.  I'm still not fully convinced myself, but here it goes... newlinechar  newlinechar We know we have Hillary dead to rights on the e-mail server at the VERY least.  We also know that she (and Bill) are the biggest swamp creatures out there and know all of the inner workings.   newlinechar  newlinechar My idea would be to put Hillary in a situation where's she facing life in prison.  It kills me to say this, but I think offering her immunity for the truth and the WHOLE truth is the best way to drain the swamp. newlinechar  newlinechar I would have her in protective custody for months and months and let her list off every crime she's ever committed and who the co-conspirators were, along with where/how to find the evidence. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure we all agree that 'too big to jail' is a problem, but another problem is the enablers that allow it to happen (Abedin, Mills, etc.).  We need to create a culture in government where unethical actions are punished, no matter who your 'protector' is.  This will dissuade lower level employees from being the henchmen for their masters.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see Hillary locked up more than almost anybody, but I also realize what far-fetched probability that is.  I think she would also be a willing witness and it would be easy to sell the idea as benefiting her. newlinechar  newlinechar We would lose the sight of seeing her behind bars, but her admissions of guilt would be inescapable.  As a result, we would get to lock up all of their aides, CF directors, human traffickers, pedophiles, dirty/illegal donors, all of the undersecretaries, congressional co-conspirators (Wasserman-Schultz, etc.), treasonous media members, and so on..... newlinechar  newlinechar Note, I don't think this scenario is likely at all, but it would be the quickest way to drain the swamp.
As a Jew, I have to agree that Jews have a lot of power and Gentiles are condemned for pointing this out. But, in Wasserman Schultz case it would do well to find out who her puppet masters really are. Are they Jews? Are they Gentiles? Is it Hillary? If so, that means that Schultz is taking orders from a shiksa, which most Jews would find repugnant. If Hillary is her 'boss', then it is an 'equal opportunity conspiracy' and not just a 'Jewish conspiracy'.

Pot is not what makes Stein act like that. Let us not perpetuate the lie that liberals need mind altering drugs to be as stupid as they are. You do a disservice to medical users of cannabis when you equate liberal retardation to be stoned. I was on the VA pharmacy for 10 years after my second tour. It really messed my life up. I started smoking cannabis about a year and a half ago and since have dropped the VA regimen. I've dropped 50 lbs, started running, sleeping, being a husband and father again, and generally starting to 'be myself' again. Cannabis is helping veterans turn their lives around and the longer we promote the D.A.R.E. era myths, the harder we make it for them to acquire what they need.

Year after year, African American males are vastly over-represented in crime victims surveys as perpetrators of violent crimes and sexual assaults.

The racist restaurateur *should* be free to discriminate even though we as a society and you and I personally disagree otherwise we are violating his constitutionally guaranteed freedom of association even though we disagree with how he uses his freedom. The civil rights movement went too far and ironically violated the fundamental underpinnings of civil rights themselves when it said *some* (now *all*) private business are 'public accommodations' and thus we can violate the businessman's personal rights in order to protect the rights of others.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can understand the motivation for that compromise of principle and violation of individual liberty based on the fear that racial discrimination by private individuals would result in a lack of real freedom on the part of blacks and other historically oppressed minorities. BUT there was no reason to think that would be the case and we never tried liberty... we went straight from Jim Crow laws that said you MUST NOT serve blacks to laws which said you MUST serve blacks and never tried freedom to see what would happen. Even if you accept the logic of 'public accommodation' applying to some private business transactions that brings to mind the grocery store being forced to accommodate blacks NOT an individual wedding photographer working out of her home forced to participate in a wedding which violates her religious beliefs as was the case in Arizona which kicked off this most recent round of lawsuits and political disputes.

Anyone who believes this was a botched robbery needs publicly pissed on. Where is Seth Rich's laptop and why isn't the contents of that being brought up. Why can't the public know what caliber bullet was used. Fucking brainwashed imbociles believe this was a botched robbery. Nothing was taken. The only reasonable motive is political murder. Why did the DNC deny the FBI access to their systems during their prove of alleged 'Russian hacking'. Seth Rich was upset with the DNC. What did he know? I guess we will never find out.

&gt;The real question when trying to be green is overall carbon footprint which covers everything required to build the car and operation of the car after purchase newlinechar  newlinechar You want a lifecycle analysis.  [Here's one](http://www.environment.ucla.edu/media/files/BatteryElectricVehicleLCA2012-rh-ptd.pdf) that includes manufacturing, transport, and disposal.  Spoiler alert: Even if you account for those things, the Prius is still better for the environment than normal cars. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What is lost in much of the debate is where parts are sourced. If a Prius battery is manufactured overseas and has to be shipped to the US, it will be put onto a cargo ship. Well cargo ships burn bunker oil which is a minimally refined fuel oil that is very polluting. newlinechar  newlinechar As per the above lifecycle analysis, at more than 1,000 miles per gallon per ton, shipping accounts for a negligible contribution to an individual Prius' lifecycle carbon footprint. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Plus, I want to know what happens to all these batteries when they die. newlinechar  newlinechar [They get recycled, of course](https://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/what-happens-to-ev-and-hybrid-batteries.html).

Can you give a credible source? Daily Signal is published by the Heritage Foundation. It seems like U.S. Business leaders and a majority of Americans want to stay in the Paris Agreement. So why get out of Paris agreement for anything other than spite? 
I think Titty Perry said it best: * 'Like, can't we just like, coexist or something, ya know?'*
Go back in time far enough, Alexander the Great toppled the Persian empire.  That certainly destabilize things.
Well I most definitely believe that man affects climate change. Maybe not to the degree that some scientists claim, but emissions are definitely a contributor.  newlinechar  newlinechar What I am against is the fact that we are the only country in the Paris Climate Agreement that have a percentage we have to lower our emissions by each and every year regardless of what all other countries in the agreement do. If we are expected to be a member of this agreement,  it must be fair. I am all for reducing emissions, but the forcefulness of the EPA and their regulations most definitely contributed to the death of several American companies who closed their doors or jumped ship to another country with less regulation. One country who took full advantage of this is China. They stepped up their industrialization with absolutely no regulations to undercut American businesses and dominate the world economy for over 2 decades. And now they want to lecture **US** on climate change???  You can fuck right off. newlinechar  newlinechar The EPA regulations are important, but the rate at which they were implemented helped to destroy the middle class. If the regulations were rolled out on a slower timeline, we could have reduced emissions gradually and ***REMAINED COMPETITIVE!!!***  This is speculation, but I bet if we were look in to past emission regulation laws, I'd imagine we would find that other countries helped lobby to pass them. They knew that American companies would crumble having to spend billions reducing emissions. And with federal tax breaks to do so, splitting the bill  with American tax payers, would help crush our entire industrial economy. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  I want to add my first hand experience with this in case my post is seen: newlinechar  newlinechar My father worked in the paper making industry. A Blue collar member of the working middle class. In the early 90s, before the strict regulations, my father and his co-workers made great money and the company he worked for was very competitive in the market. The workers were given regular raises and with overtime,  they were regularly bringing in over $100k per year after taxes. After government intervention and regulation, sales stagnated significantly. They went from upper 20% profit to under 18%  Wages also stagnated. When he retired just 2 years ago, he was bringing down just under $120k per year before taxes. **That is almost 30 years WITH NO RAISES BEING GIVEN.** No more raises.  The company changed hands about 4 or 5 times over the course of 20 years and eventually they closed the doors. My father was lucky enough that he was ready to retire, but 400 or so other workers were not.  You see, for over 20 years, due mostly to strict EPA regulations and low tariffs,  China could produce, ship, and market to the USA much cheaper than his company could do so **ON AMERICAN SOIL.**  We wonder where the middle class went... look no further than our own government. We killed the middle class while China built their own. We were already ahead of the  game and far and away ahead of them on EPA regulations before they got strict. China doesn't care about the environment. They are pushing this narrative to keep us down. So they can keep shipping their products here cheaper than we can produce them here.  newlinechar  newlinechar As I said before, I believe climate change is real and mankind definitely affects it, but we must consider our economy and the dwindling middle class. Before long, there will be no middle class.  As I am sure you are all aware,  The middle class has always, and continues, to foot the tax bill. The very Rich and very poor pay little to no taxes. Who will pay for our missile defense systems, our military, our education, our fucking healthcare, and our entire way of life when the middle class is finally gone?  We will be run by China and other economic super powers.

There are actual predators that are committing crimes.  We should be specific, and have evidence.  Saying it's full of pedophiles risks a backlash and ends the conversation.

&gt;Lite in that you're views are nowhere near as extreme as theirs.   newlinechar  newlinechar They're not even on the same spectrum. It's like comparing liberalism with conservatism. There is very little if any overlap.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You're a civic nationalist.  You reject multiculturalism.   newlinechar  newlinechar Correct. I reject multiculturalism but I'm fine with multiethnicism if that's even a word. You get what I mean.    newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They're ethnic nationalist, they reject other races.   newlinechar  newlinechar They only care about the ethnic part. I've yet to see any concrete proof that they are nationalist. If they were, then they would have to concede that Black people are part of the original settlers and as such have just as strong a claim to American citizenship as any white dude whose ancestors came over on the mayflower. They also don't care about what kind of white person you are. If they really cared about having the nation be comprised of its original ancestry, then they would reject all other variants of Caucasian other than British and Dutch. The rest came much later. They would also be cool with Jews considering Washington personally ensured Jewish acceptance into the original post-revolution society through his letters. So despite your claims that I don't know what I'm talking about, im right and they're wrong. They're just butthurt racists at the end of the day. They literally only care about ethnicity and don't at all care about our history.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They're not all that far apart. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes they are, see above. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I myself lean more toward civic nationalism but I certainly do find intrigue in some of their arguments.   newlinechar  newlinechar That's fine, do you. Doesn't mean I have to like what they say or give it any  credence. In addition to being plain old factually incorrect, they make us look absolutely terrible. The stormfags brigade literally everything we do. We are not on the same side. Watch what they do on any given Cernovitch or Scott Adams periscope. They even troll Styx and he's a lot more accepting of them than Cernovitch or Adams. We shouldn't be defending our opponents.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Most aren't nationalist socialist. newlinechar  newlinechar Then why do they advocate for that political system? Why praise Hitler if they reject all the political aspects of Hitler that brought about his entire regime? Seems like a cop out. Besides, how can they possibly call themselves American nationalists when they openly support arguably our greatest enemy ever?   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This subreddit was where the altright originated in regards to trump.   newlinechar  newlinechar Not really.

It is strange and should be alarming that, after a history of Republicans using conspiracies as a political tool -- SUDDENLY -- in 2016, Democrats hit upon a big one -- the Russia hacking thing. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I'm gonna annoy everyone and get down voted, but oh well. :) newlinechar  newlinechar Donald Trump represents the culmination of a long-standing Republican REACTIONARY goal to push the paradigm further to the 'right.' Despite some of his rhetoric, in practice, he is only implementing policies that turn the clock back. This is exactly the stated Koch brothers/libertarian agenda that has been around for decades. newlinechar  newlinechar FYI, the libertarian agenda comes directly out of the attempted coup that Smedley Butler exposed in the mid-1930's. Having failed in the coup, they created libertarianism. newlinechar  newlinechar Interestingly, Republicans, who grumble about how terrible Donald Trump is wind up supporting him on everything but the most *politically* dangerous thing -- the ACHA. Even there, the House supports him. newlinechar  newlinechar Now to the Democrats and the 'deep state': newlinechar  newlinechar With Donald Trump bringing back into vogue the oppression of large segments of the population through, no longer having to couch identity politics in economic terms (as admitted directly by Republican operative Lee Atwater and described by OP with the 'welfare queen'), Democrats are free to become reactionary themselves! newlinechar  newlinechar In a strange twist, Democrats are drum-beating for war-like relations with Russia, while Donald Trump is *pretending* to support Russia. Never mind that the anti-Russia agenda was written by the George Bush administration in 1992 and followed closely by both parties ever since. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no way in the world that establishment Republicans would like to ease relations with Russia, and yet they support Donald Trump on the substance practically every time. What could explain this? Either the whole thing will turn into one big double cross, or Republicans will use Donald Trump to implement their own agenda and then dispose of him like they have to so many others. And that leaves Donald Trump with the blame for the Republican agenda, and plausible deniability for the rest of the Republicans. newlinechar  newlinechar Back to the Democrats.  newlinechar  newlinechar Once Donald Trump said the media was the 'enemy,' a very quick *reaction* occurred where may Democrats rushed to support the corporate media -- actually calling it a 'free press.' newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, with the recent paradigm shift, most everyone should take a side -- a side that is harmful to people and useful to the oligarchs. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you for the 'free press' or do you think MSM is the 'enemy'? newlinechar  newlinechar Which do you choose? The MSM or Breitbart? newlinechar  newlinechar Are you for the 'Russian puppet' or do you think we need to escalate tensions? newlinechar  newlinechar These paradigm shifting questions are the worst obfuscation of reality I have ever seen.

Curious about your opinion on evergreen college. 
My first two jobs after school were in the renewable energy sector.  I worked as a process engineer and research engineer.  From what I have studied, researched, and worked on I do not believe the Paris Agreement is the answer.  CO2 levels will continue to rise due to: 3rd world countries, industrialization of China, and natural climate change.  I grew up on the gulf coast and believe the biggest challenge we face is the amount of plastic in our oceans.  The ocean is a perfect system to break down plastic into smaller parts.   The BP oil spill impacted the lives of friends, family, and myself. I am more interested in the progression of nuclear energy, solar energy, and alternative fuel sources than worrying about CO2 levels generated from coal for electric and industry power.

His logic is that the Dems demonized Russia. This pissed off Russian Americans. Those Russian Americans then supported Trump. No where does he ever insinuate that there was collusion between Russia and Trump. But that it was simple citizens that could have helped. Also notice that none of his statements were concrete. He used words like 'possibly'. So he isn't even saying that any of this actually happened. Just that it could have.  newlinechar  newlinechar So this doesn't change anything. This doesn't show any signs of collusion between Trump and Russia. There is still 0 evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.

And do you know why that is? Because the group building the mosque increased the size of the mosque and increased estimates of how many people will attend its services...   newlinechar The fact of the matter is the mosque was proposed to be built by razing an existing residence, located between two other residences, is directly across the street from 3 residences, with another residential property behind. The proposal called for more than 100 parking spaces and a 4,250' building (much more than is there now) even though the property has some wetlands on it. Previous failed development proposals in recent years in the immediate neighborhood include expanding the pastor's manse owned by Liberty Corner Church, and a new church site for Millington Baptist Church. Having been elected to multiple terms on the township committee and serving as Mayor, Ali Chaudry knows the anti-development history of Liberty Corner. Why he would choose such a controversial location for a mosque, where there were, and are, other more suitable properties nearby is beyond me.

Sulla is a controversial figure on a good day. And an example of how history is written by the victor. - In 81 BC, after his second march on Rome, he revived the office of dictator which had been inactive since the Second Punic War over a century before, and used his powers to enact a series of reforms to the Roman Constitution, meant to restore the primacy of the Senate and limit tribune power. Sulla's ascension was also marked by political purges in proscriptions.

It's actually not a laced corset. It has a black beaded pattern that makes it appear like a corset in the out of focused picture.

Even in regular plays artists exaggerate lashes and makeup to the point they look like clowns up close.

Drag queens have to go even further as their makeup needs to appear overdone as they are intentionally exaggerating a diva.

Obama, and I believe almost every President before him, has also given ethics waivers to staff. In fact most of the bad things Trump does have been done before, by both Democrats and Republicans. newlinechar  newlinechar However Trump takes it to a whole new level, granting mass exceptions to rules that prior Administrations granted relatively sparingly. Also Trump tried to give these waivers in secret. They were only made public after an intense dispute with the Office of Government Ethics according to the NYTimes ([link](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/lobbyist-ethics-waivers-trump-administration.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0)). newlinechar  newlinechar With past administrations I could believe that such exemptions were being granted on a case-by-case basis after careful consideration. After all, even the most well intentioned rule has edge cases where it would be fairer to not apply it. When it is done on a relatively large scale I find it much harder to believe that it is just dealing with edge cases.

You've done something worthwhile.  Do not allow your spirit to be broken.  Most of humanity never comes close to the impact you can make.  Let that drive you.  There are several ways to think about this and you should be compensated for this so don't think about giving it away yet.

There's too many ways to trace, plus you honestly don't know if the police are part of it (I live in an area where we do have a lot of police corruption issues/bribes taken). 
I think the thing we may be missing in this discussion here is that as bad as the people in the swamp are and as bad as Clinton is and how much I'd love to see all the treasonous people jailed and how I want the Deep State gone, it's worse than all that. The real problem is who Clinton and all them work for. It goes higher. I'd gladly give Clinton immunity if it ended the hold that certain groups have on our government and many other governments. You've all heard their names, it's no joke. I'd gladly give Clinton immunity if it eradicated the Shadow Government. 
Shhhhhhh. Let her keep talking.

Ok but I don't think the Paris agreement is specifically only about CO2. And if Trump is for clean energy but doesn't believe in CO2 data then he should come out and say that. My impression from him is that he is against incentivizing clean energy.

This sub shitting on this guy for being a billionaire and taking advantage of government programs that save him money is so fucking hypocritical. Who cares if he disagrees with Trump on the Paris climate deal/PR stunt, practically everybody does.
 How the fuck......
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy as far as I'm concerned.

I think that rule needs to be removed. There are better ways to deal with shills than being forbidden to label them newlinechar  newlinechar We need a crowd sourced shill database, where if you spot shill behaviour you can add the username and the proof into the spreadsheet. Shill behaviour would be defined by a few short rules. newlinechar  newlinechar The example from this thread is attacking users for having new or rather inactive accounts and not their argument. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I get where you're coming from.
I would love a rule placed on all broadcasters in the US that you are allowed to post whatever edited interview you like on your broadcasting network but according to FCC law (basically if you have a FCC license to broadcast you must follow this rule) an unedited version must be posted online for the public to view. newlinechar  newlinechar It can even be super boring like literally a daily list of:  newlinechar  newlinechar 6-1-2017 3pm X Interview newlinechar  newlinechar Would really make the scummy MSM more honest and what would they complain about? newlinechar  newlinechar Bandwidth? Please newlinechar  newlinechar I mean if you don't edit your interviews to drive a narrative (The Daily Show unedited clips would be the best what I wouldn't give to have access to them) why would it be a bad thing.

&gt;If its time for Europe to lead, as you say, that means that THEY will be the ones who will manufacture and sell while leaving the US behind.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, because Europe doesn't value U.S dollars and trade.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This agreement ensures that we have a seat at the table as far as manufacturing and selling renewables in the global market. Pulling out will allow China and Germany to take all of the income away from the US.  newlinechar  newlinechar The U.S will always have a seat at the table because we have the world's 2nd largest economy behind Europe. While Europe depletes resources rebuilding their military and babysitting refugees and battling domestic terrorism the U.S will continue trading with the rest of the world. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Think of this agreement more like one of Trumps executive orders - they are not law but rather a change in direction as to where we want to eventually end up. There is a MASSIVE market for renewable energy and we are pretty much saying that we do not want any part of that market share.  newlinechar  newlinechar No we aren't, please try again.  Nothing is stopping private companies and private consumers from buying renewables and developing renewables. And if the try to impose tarrifs and punish U.S companies they will suffer consequences of their own.  newlinechar  newlinechar 
People of the Donald. newlinechar  newlinechar Tesla makes zero money, in fact they burn massive amounts of money. How do they get away with burning massive amounts of money? Over promising, issuing stock for sale, selling the offering, and continue to burn more cash. newlinechar  newlinechar When cash supplies get low, he announces a new thing, a new dream, in order to raise more cash from outside investors or the government. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not clear that this company will ever turn a real profit, especially now that they bought solar city, are working on trucks, building the factory etc. And if he loses the government bucks which are super low interest loans and subsidies, he is toast. newlinechar  newlinechar Musk is smart, but tesla is more of a Ponzi scheme than a profitable company like Ford, GM, Honda or Toyota

SpaceX is a private enterprise. They get plenty of contracts and money. Lockheed, Boeing, Ford. If it allows technology that has the ability to create much money and many many US jobs, I do not see any issue with the government investing in this.

If that bothers you then you might have ideological problems. 
Its near impossible to avoid completely, but yes, more home cooking, fresh foods, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar Keep in mind, natural sugars are ok - the kind you have when you eat fruit.  But don't trust fruit juice because they sweeten it and have a loose idea of 'natural'. newlinechar  newlinechar Essentially its clean living.  Use fruits and veggies as your go-to for snacks (you can literally never eat enough of those to be bad for you), and if you do buy store-bought items, try to limit things to 5g of sugar or less per serving.  For instance, for breakfast, I have Rice Chex cereal with Organic Soy Milk. newlinechar  newlinechar If you love to eat out, keep in mind that the cheap places use ingredients high in refined sugars - pre-jarred sauces and the like.  However, if you love Sushi, that actually is an excellent takeout food, as are a lot of Japanese cuisine (so long as you stay away from having fried items a lot or tons of mayo-based sauces - a little bit here and there is ok). newlinechar  newlinechar The thing to keep in mind is sugar will try to pull you back in.  I detoxed, and treated myself with my family to frozen yogurt.  That week, I found myself snacking more on chips and pretzels, which you wouldn't think would be bad, but even pretzels have sugar.  I ended up almost going back to my old eating habits before I realized what was going on and put a stop to it (I'm detoxing again). newlinechar  newlinechar What was fascinating to me, at least with my chemistry and sugar, is the more my sugar craving came back, the more on edge I was, the less content I was with the status quo of my household, and my mentality shifted to one of discontent.  When I was completely off sugar, I was happier, more satisfied with life, and felt more mentally clear.  And that doesn't even cover no shakes or sugar crashes in the afternoon. newlinechar  newlinechar It really hit me when I was fully detoxed from Sugar finally (took me 3 weeks to feel 'right'), and I walked through the grocery store, and randomly picked up items to check the sugar content - and felt disgusted.  Even 'healthy' things had sugar content between 10-30g.  That's when it hit me just how this sort of thing doesn't happen by accident.
I agree with you.  Soros is an underling.   I just don't think Hillary would be of any help whatsoever.   She's vindictive and full of hate, and once she got her immunity should would produce nothing but disinformation.
&gt;The only two things I can think of that give legitamacy to the flat earth are: if space is supposed to be endless and a vacuum, we'd have no atmosphere if something wasn't protecting it.   newlinechar  newlinechar [Very common misconception](https://www.quora.com/If-space-is-a-vacuum-then-why-doesnt-it-suck-in-all-the-air-from-Earths-atmosphere) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar ______________________ newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And the distance from the sun, if the earth is tilted on its axis at night parts of the equator would be twice as far away as either poles.  How come it doesn't freeze?  newlinechar  newlinechar Another common misconception, [but the seasons/temperature on earth doesn't correlate with the distance to the sun](http://www.space.com/3304-earth-closest-sun-dead-winter.html) newlinechar

That's not what I said (or meant to say)  at all... newlinechar  newlinechar If Trump colluded with Russia, obviously Trump is in trouble. If Trump didn't collude with Russia, then good on him. If Russia interfered then Russia is in trouble. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand how you can read HRC into my comment, but I haven't thought of her since Jan 25th.

I thought 2030 was just the year China had agreed to stop increasing emissions?  Was there any language for them ever reducing?  At any time in the future?  I thought the plan was to give them another 12/13 years to really hit the peak of their industrialization and then hold them to whatever insane levels of emission they have reached for perpetuity going forward from there?  Or were we planning to renegotiate with them after their decade + of continued and unfettered maximum industrialization?
