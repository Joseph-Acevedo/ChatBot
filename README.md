# ChatBot

This project was an implementation of a ChatBot following the tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/sentdex, done by Joseph Acevedo and Archie Shahidullah as a final project for Capstone Critical Literary Theory.

Two sets of training data were compliled from subreddits that were related to Democrats and Republicans in order to train two seperate chatbots and have them communicate with each other. Unfortunately due to time and resource restrictions only one chatbot was created using Republican subreddits for training data.
